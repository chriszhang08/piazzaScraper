Welcome to Piazza!
Piazza is a Q&A platform designed to get you great answers from classmates and instructors fast. We've put together this list of tips you might find handy as you get started:
<br/>


<ol style="margin:0;padding:0;list-style-position:inside;"> <li style="margin:0;padding:0"><strong>Ask questions!</strong><br/><br/>The best way to get answers is to ask questions! Ask questions on Piazza rather than emailing your teaching staff so everyone can benefit from the response (and so you can get answers from classmates who are up as late as you are).<br/><br/></li><li style="margin:0;padding:0"><strong>Edit questions and answers wiki-style.</strong><br/><br/>Think of Piazza as a Q&amp;A wiki for your class. Every question has just a single <strong>students' answer</strong> that students can edit collectively (and a single <strong>instructors’ answer</strong> for instructors).<br/><br/></li><li style="margin:0;padding:0"> <strong>Add a followup to comment or ask further questions.</strong><br/><br/>To comment on or ask further questions about a post, start a <strong>followup discussion</strong>. Mark it resolved when the issue has been addressed, and add any relevant information back into the Q&amp;A above.<br/><br/></li><li style="margin:0;padding:0"> <strong>Go anonymous.</strong><br/><br/>Shy? No problem. You can always opt to post or edit anonymously.<br/><br/></li><li style="margin:0;padding:0"> <strong>Tag your posts.</strong><br/><br/>It's far more convenient to find all posts about your Homework 3 or Midterm 1 when the posts are tagged. Type a “#” before a key word to tag. Click a blue tag in a post or the question feed to filter for all posts that share that tag.<br/><br/></li><li style="margin:0;padding:0"> <strong>Format code and equations.</strong><br/><br/>Adding a code snippet? Click the <strong>pre</strong> or <strong>tt</strong> button in the question editor to add pre-formatted or inline teletype text. <br/>Mathematical equation? Click the <strong>Fx</strong> button to access the LaTeX editor to build a nicely formatted equation.<br/><br/></li><li style="margin:0;padding:0"> <strong>View and download class details and resources.</strong> </li></ol>

Welcome and Important Info Below!
<p>Welcome to the Piazza page for EECS 280!  Please read this post thoroughly to not miss any important information.</p>


<p></p>


<p>This is a space for you to <strong>ask (and answer!) questions</strong> about technical material in the course and about course projects.</p>


<p></p>


<p>Piazza is intended as a resource for <strong>current EECS 280</strong> students. We ask that students not currently enrolled in the course refrain from participating (either asking or answering questions).</p>


<p></p>


<p>As always, <strong>be kind</strong> to your fellow students and instructors!</p>


<p></p>


<p>Please <strong>don't post your code publicly</strong> on Piazza. Doing so is a violation of the Honor Code. If you need help, either go to office hours or make a <strong>private post</strong> (visible only to you and the instructors).</p>


<p></p>


<p>All course information and links can be found at our <strong>website</strong>. <a href="http://eecs280.org/" rel="noreferrer" target="_blank">http://eecs280.org/</a></p>


<p>(alternate link: <a href="https://eecs280staff.github.io/eecs280.org/" rel="noreferrer" target="_blank">https://eecs280staff.github.io/eecs280.org/</a>)</p>


<p></p>


<p>A few more things...</p>


<p></p>


<p>1) To help answer your question we sometimes look things up, which often requires a uniqname. To save time, and thus allow us to answer your questions more quickly,<br/><strong>please make a small setup change to Piazza</strong>. Go to the upper right corner, next to your name, and click on the gear there. Select Account/Email settings. On the screen that appears, after your "Full Name", add your uniqname in parentheses as shown below.<br/><img height="186" src="https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/1cmiArfD6g7GuTptRVgTmDohU8jlmx67hQz4C2F89r1gbmAFF19Fe_QRGR1PtW5YT-w2zPonivUUXBUT2nHX1bRTkI4d_u-Do4YGMB0N3HlPe5gOmR9OX3_J20--HKe79WLD4u-v" width="479"/></p>


<p><br/>2) Please make use of Piazza's search bar before posting a new question. You will save everybody's time that way! If you see a question that has been asked before, feel free to link to it using "@". For example, we will link to this post by means of <a href="/class/ksoz9z684qy18u?cid=6" rel="noreferrer" target="_blank"></a><a data-pats="post_ref" href="6" onclick="return PE.gotoPost('6');">@6</a>.</p>


<p></p>


<p>Note: If you are posting a screenshot of an error, please also include some searchable test in the post to describe your error. Ex: "X Code error Command usr/bin/make/ failed with exit code 2"</p>


<p></p>


<p>3) Find all dates and times for office hours, discussions, and due dates at our course calendar on our website linked above<strong>.</strong> Any super-mega-important changes (like a change in a due date) will be emailed to everyone, and any not-as-important changes (like rescheduling office hours) may be reflected on the calendar. See the calendar for all lectures, labs, and office hours for the week.<br/><br/>4) Every project will have an FAQ post to save time with asking and answering questions<strong>.</strong> Please refer to that post before asking any questions related to projects. If you notice a question as been asked multiple times, you can suggest something be added to that particular post.<br/><br/>5) It's sometimes difficult to identify a compiler error based on a written description. If you have a compiler error, please post the full output. This includes the command you used to compile as well as the error messages. If you have to scroll to see all of your errors, post the ones that appear first and indicate it goes beyond that. Also, a snippet of the lines of code that are causing this error is helpful.<br/><br/>Stay tuned for more announcements/tutorials/links from your fellow instructors!<br/><br/>#pintroduction</p>

tutorial
<p>In the tutorial, I am confused about what exactly they mean by "On Windows, it’s “Bash on Ubuntu on Windows”. This is right after I checked my tools on Ubuntu. (I am using windows 10 pro on hp)</p>


<h2>Starter files<a href="https://eecs280staff.github.io/p1-stats/setup.html#starter-files" rel="noreferrer" target="_blank"></a></h2>


<p>In this section, we’ll download the starter files and get our project to compile by adding function stubs.</p>


<p>Open your shell for this step. On macOS and Linux, that’s the Terminal application. On Windows, it’s “Bash on Ubuntu on Windows”.</p>

-------------------------------------------------
<p>Likely, that's referring to using Windows Subsystem for Linux on Windows</p>

-------------------------------------------------
<p>It just means to use Ubuntu, which I assume you downloaded following <a href="https://eecs280staff.github.io/p1-stats/setup_wsl.html" rel="noreferrer" target="_blank">this</a></p>

Debugging
<p>Good afternoon, </p>


<p></p>


<p>In the tutorial, I've gotten to the point when we select the debugging environment. I'm running a windows device, which advises using C++(DGB/LLDB). However, the option is not available to me. I've made sure the C/C++ extension is installed, as well as uninstalled and reinstalled VSCode to make sure VSCode was added to my PATH. I then tried installing the debugging extension recommended to Apple M1 chip users. When I installed this debugger, it shows up and I can create the launch.json file. In the launch.json file, I put what was recommended for windows users. Doing this, I am able to debug and find the first error shown in the tutorial, however, when I do any of the debugging options, such as "step over", my debugger quits and I have to rerun it. Because of this, it only ever shows me the first step of the debugging section of the tutorial.</p>


<p></p>


<p>I have also tried the recommended Apple M1 launch.json, but this only returns an error saying "unable to find executable for 'my file location'"</p>


<p></p>


<p>Any help would be appreciated! Thank you!</p>

-------------------------------------------------
<p>See the screenshot and answer for <a data-pats="post_ref" href="10" onclick="return PE.gotoPost('10');">@10</a> - I think you're encountering the same issue. Sorry about the inconvenience!</p>

C++ Environment Not Available for Debugging
<p>Hello,</p>


<p>When I try to set up the debugger, the C++ or GDB/LLDB environment does not show up in the options for a debugging environment. I have already installed the C++ extension, so I don't know why it won't show up.</p>


<p><img alt="" height="144" src="/redirect/s3?bucket=uploads&amp;prefix=paste%2Fksy2v236ihf38t%2F2ad012ae0cf38a76d4055968864f650f93fba185c48108292a0f0c1549435df6%2Fdebugging.png" width="567"/></p>

-------------------------------------------------
<p>Looks like there may be an issue in the latest version of either VS Code or the C/C++ extension where it doesn't give the proper options in that dropdown list. Sorry about the inconvenience! We'll work on updating our tutorial to compensate.</p>


<p></p>


<p>For now, you can just go ahead and hit enter in that dropdown without choosing any debugger configuration and it will create an empty launch.json file. That's fine, since in a few steps our tutorial will have you copy in the proper contents for that file anyway, replacing whatever is there.</p>

Compiling Project 1
<p>I'm getting this error when trying to type in the "make stats_tests.exe". However, when it first runs it has the same output as the instructions, but a couple of seconds later it adds the extra error code. Make clean works if that's worth noting. I'm wondering how I go about fixing this? Thanks for the help!</p>


<p><img alt="" height="145" src="/redirect/s3?bucket=uploads&amp;prefix=paste%2Fl7caz44o3c76oc%2F797bfd041e393136abdcca3619c597800aa50cef02c74314b923a1d26e5bdbdf%2FMake_error_screenshot.png" width="1525"/></p>


<p></p>

-------------------------------------------------
<p>Are stats.h and stats.cpp in the same directory as stats_tests.cpp? And does stats.cpp have the contents copied from the tutorial?</p>

-------------------------------------------------
<p>I was able to figure it out. I needed to download the MakeFile extension and now it's giving me the correct output. Thank you for the response either way!</p>

<p>Hi, I believe I have followed the tutorial properly up to this point, but get this error when I try to debug. I do have a stats_tests.exe. Any help is appreciated.</p>

<div class="markdown" id="q38kRj58oo0ooY"><p>Try running <code>make stats_tests.exe</code> in the terminal and then debugging again.</p></div>

-------------------------------------------------
<p>Since stats_tests.exe is showing up in your directory, maybe it's looking in the wrong directory? Try running "pwd" (that command "prints your working directory") in your terminal and see if it outputs the same path given in the error message ("/mnt/c/.../projects")</p>

-------------------------------------------------
<p>Thank you, its working now.</p>

-------------------------------------------------
<p>I'm running into a similar problem. I've tried to make clean and then make stats_tests.exe however when I try to debug, VSCode still returns an error. I did notice that my error is more general and says that stats_tests doesn't exist but I'm not sure if that matters. Does anyone have any suggestions on how I might overcome this issue? Thanks!</p>

C++ not G++ compiler
<p>I am on the compiling part of the VS Code tutorial on mac, however, my compiler is c++ not g++. Not sure what to do.</p>


<p></p>


<p></p>


<p><img alt="" height="102" src="/redirect/s3?bucket=uploads&amp;prefix=paste%2Fksyntjtu1l910h%2F4719f81225cd2dccc33b4e6657bd9a4e03171721ee0c9dc270bd066a5bd041e5%2FScreen_Shot_2022-08-29_at_8.40.27_AM.png" width="1904"/></p>

-------------------------------------------------
<p>I believe that `c++` often just represents whatever compiler you have on your system. That could very well be g++. You could maybe try taking a look at the first line of your Makefile (`CXX`) and see if you can change that from `c++` to `g++</p>

-------------------------------------------------
<p>I think that should be fine. Does stats_tests.exe exist in your directory after running that?</p>

-------------------------------------------------
<p>My Makefile says CXX ?= g++. I do not think I changed it from c++, but I might have. Either way I am still compiling with c++.</p>

-------------------------------------------------
<p>The ?= assignment will only assign the value if CXX isn't already set, which it probably is. If you want the command to use g++, change it to "CXX = g++".</p>

Not authorized to access Gradescope
<p>Hi,</p>

<p>I was trying to access the EECS 280 Gradescope from the menu on the left-hand side of the class website. However, when I clicked on Gradescope, it took me to Gradescope with a red error message reading "You are not authorized to access this page." Is there any way I could be given access? Or has the Gradescope not been opened yet?</p>

<p><strong>Q: I’m getting an error in CAEN when I try to compile my code that looks like</strong></p>


<p></p>


<p><code>/usr/bin/ld: cannot find /usr/lib64/libasan.so.0.0.0</code></p>


<p></p>


<p><code>collect2: error: ld returned 1 exit status</code></p>


<p></p>


<p><code>make: *** [stats_tests.exe] Error 1</code></p>


<p></p>


<p>A: Try changing the gcc version by running the following command:</p>


<p></p>


<pre>module load gcc/7.1.0</pre>
<p>You can add the following command to automatically change the gcc version every time you log in:</p>


<p></p>


<pre>echo "module load gcc/7.1.0" &gt;&gt; ~/.bash_profile</pre>
<p><strong>Q: Why am I unable to view console output in macOS vsCode?</strong></p>


<p></p>


<p>A: For Mac users on VSCode, install the “codeLLDB” extension instead of the “C/C++” extension and then set externalConsole to “true”. Now when you run the visual debugger, it will open a new “Terminal” window</p>


<p></p>


<p><strong>Q: I’m getting the error that “call of overloaded abs(double) is ambiguous” when I’m trying to compare floating points as used in Appendix F of the spec.</strong></p>


<p></p>


<p>A: Try adding <code>#include &lt;cmath&gt;</code> to the top of the file.</p>


<p></p>


<p><strong>Q: I haven't worked with vectors before - are there any recommended resources?</strong></p>


<p></p>


<p>A: You can find a number of vector tutorials online that give a decent introduction. Additionally, here are some links to the ENGR 101 Runestone materials with an introduction to vectors in C++. (These links are to a development server that isn't terribly reliable, but it avoids you having to make a Runestone account. If it doesn't load immediately, try refreshing the page a few times until it does.)</p>

<p></p>


<p><strong>Q: When I ssh into CAEN, I get put in the root folder (/) instead of my home directory (/home/uniqname/)</strong></p>


<p></p>


<p>A: For some reason, your home directory was not created automatically. You can request for one to be created for you at the <a href="https://ifsprovisioning.its.umich.edu/ifs_storage/request" rel="noreferrer" target="_blank">IFS storage request page</a>. </p>

<p>Hi Kevin,</p>


<p></p>


<p>I was running into the exact same problem as Ziming's - whenever I try to run the debugger for stats.cpp, it says that: </p>


<p>Undefined symbols for architecture x86_64:<br/>  "sum(std::__1::vector&lt;double, std::__1::allocator&lt;double&gt; &gt;)", referenced from:<br/>      test_sum_small_data_set() in stats_tests-6940bf.o</p>


<p></p>


<p>I have attached a screenshot of my terminal after running the make stats\_tests.exe from the setup tutorial - somehow something is wrong. When I first set my computer up, nothing went wrong like this. Is there any possibility that you know what is going wrong? Thank you so much!</p>

<p>Thank you for your help!</p>

-------------------------------------------------
<div class="markdown" id="q38kRj58oo3ooY"><p>make sure you are running in the caen linux environment, you can make sure by running <code>hostname</code> and checking to make sure you have <code>umich.edu</code> at the end (if you have <code>.local</code> at the end, it means you are running it on your own laptop)</p>

<p>Anything you can think of that could cause this?</p>


<p>Thanks!</p>


<p></p>

-------------------------------------------------
<p>That's the expected behavior. As discussed in lecture "assert(/*something*/)" will crash the program if /*something*/ evaluates to false. Once you add implementations for all the functions (including "sum"), you must remove the "assert(false)" statements.</p>

-------------------------------------------------
<p>Ok i'm glad that was expected however I thought my compiler was supposed to successfully compile.  </p>

-------------------------------------------------
<p>It is compiling and running. What you are seeing is the output from running your program.</p>

-------------------------------------------------
<p>no output...</p>


<p></p>

-------------------------------------------------
<p>"Assertion failed: (false)..." is the output of your program.</p>

<p></p>


<p>This is the full output </p>


<p></p>

-------------------------------------------------
<p>I understand. The text in blue is the output of your program. It means that your program compiled and is running as expected. Try replacing "assert(false)" on line 14 with "cout &lt;&lt; "hello" &lt;&lt; endl;" and you should see that printing out.</p>

-------------------------------------------------
<p>sorry I meant to follow this up </p>

-------------------------------------------------
<p>I'm guessing this wasn't recompiled after making the change. Try typing "make stats_tests.exe" in your terminal and rerunning.</p>

-------------------------------------------------
<p>What would be your guess on how to fix that? Do you know what a "void" function is?</p>

-------------------------------------------------
<p>I'm having this issue with running the debugger.  stats_tests.exe does exist and it is within my p1-stats folder.</p>


<p></p>


<p>.<img alt="" height="522" src="/redirect/s3?bucket=uploads&amp;prefix=paste%2Fkt1svhk7y782nd%2Fc17ef78d0465a309bccbc04680ed731bda631fe3ae57f5c8425c1324078bf2e5%2Fimage.png" width="858"/> </p>

-------------------------------------------------
<p>Did you compile the files? When you make clean, it deletes the exe files, so running the debugger will result in it not finding the stats_test.exe file. Try running make test so that it will compile your desired file. Note that if you have a compiler error, then there is no way to enter debugging mode as the exe file fails to be built.</p>

Installing VSCode on mac
<p>I'm trying to follow the "Setting up VS Code" section of the setup but when I try running the following code:</p>


<p></p>


<p>    <strong>$brew install --cask visual-studio-code</strong></p>


<p></p>


<p>I receive an error:</p>


<p></p>


<p>   <strong>Error: It seems there is already an App at '/Applications/Visual Studio Code.app'.</strong></p>


<p></p>


<p>I tried running the following code:</p>

<p></p>


<p>But I receive:</p>


<p></p>


<p>   <strong>zsh: command not found: code</strong></p>


<p></p>


<p>I already tried restarting the tutorial and removing all the files I had earlier. I talked with Prof. Beaumont, but he wasn't familiar with the mac setup process.</p>

-------------------------------------------------
<p>Try this <a href="https://code2care.org/zsh/resolve-zsh-command-not-found-code-error" rel="noreferrer" target="_blank">solution</a>.</p>

how to fix this problem with wget?
<p>I am trying to complete the setup tutorial. I have gotten to <strong>Download and unpack starter files </strong>but when I try the "wget <a href='https://eecs280staff.github.io/p1-stats/starter-files.tar.gz"' target="_blank">https://eecs280staff.github.io/p1-stats/starter-files.tar.gz"</a>; command, I get this error:</p>


<p></p>


<p>wget : The response content cannot be parsed because the Internet Explorer engine is not available, or Internet<br/>Explorer's first-launch configuration is not complete. Specify the UseBasicParsing parameter and try again.</p>


<p></p>


<p>Unfortunately, when I try " wget <a href="https://eecs280staff.github.io/p1-stats/starter-files.tar.gz" target="_blank">https://eecs280staff.github.io/p1-stats/starter-files.tar.gz</a> -UseBasicParsing", I get this output:</p>

<p></p>


<p>And the file isn't added to the repository, the ls command returns nothing. I've tried looking online but I haven't found any solutions. How do I fix this so I can continue on with the setup tutorial?</p>

Main Setup Tutorial - Setup Caen- Avoiding Repeated 2FA
<p>I was able to get pretty far in the tutorial without too much trouble, but I am struggling a bit here. I am able to get through the Caen setup for the most part with it producing the prompts that the tutorial suggests, but after I do the cat. ~/.ssh/config and then move onto the section asking to open a second directory, my pwd shows up as my uniqname/home, as opposed to my uniqname/eecs280/p1-stats. The subsequent line of code therefore doesn't build a file list, but says something about modifying an IP address, and I'm not sure how to fix it or where to go from here. I've tried exiting/restarting from that section several times, but to no avail. Any suggestions so that I can finish this tutorial and move onto my program would be greatly appreciated. Thank you so much! </p>


<p></p>


<p></p>

-------------------------------------------------
<div class="markdown" id="q38kRj58oo0ooY"><p>For now, try doing <code>cd uniqname/eecs280/p1-stats</code> right before that <code>pwd</code> and see if everything works.</p></div>

-------------------------------------------------
<p>For some reason, it is now saying:</p>


<p>-bash: cd: amelillo/eecs280/p1-stats: No such file or directory. Any idea why? </p>


<p></p>


<p>Thank you so much!</p>

-------------------------------------------------
<div class="markdown" id="q38kRj58oo2ooY"><p>Ah I see. So there’s an implied step (which should probably be better specified) that you first <code>cd</code> into the folder that you made for 280/p1-stats. <code>pwd</code> shows you your current directory, so when it’s shown there it’s basically saying “you should be in this directory before executing anything below”. Kinda confusing.</p></div>

-------------------------------------------------
<p>I'm so sorry, but I'm still somewhat lost. I typed in cd and the name of my folder (which I know exists) and it's still saying that it does not exist. As of now, I get the SSH into Caen Linux without a problem, but when I try to cd back into my p1-stats directory in the second terminal, I keep getting this same message:</p>


<p>audreymelillo@Audreys-MacBook-Air-4 .ssh % </p>


<p>-bash: cd: p1-stats: No such file or directory. I tried exiting and doing the same process with the cd, but received the same message. I'm happy to come to office hours tomorrow when they open, I just really want to finish this tutorial so I can start grappling with the project. Thank you so much for all your help! </p>

-------------------------------------------------
<p>Never mind, I figured it out! Thank you so much!</p>

<p>Say that P = 100. Then, k = N and we are trying to access $v_{N+1}$ in the 1-indexed system, which is out of bounds. Do we treat 100 percentile as 99 percentile?</p>

Median function project 1
<p>For the median function required to implement in Project 1, can we use the sort function provided in p1_library.h to sort the vector and find the actual median, or are we trying to find the ninther as defined the wikipedia page?</p>

-------------------------------------------------
<div class="markdown" id="q38kRj58oo0ooY"><p>You should use the <code>sort</code> function and compute the median as you normally would manually.</p></div>

Lab switch
<p>I was initially in a Wednesday lab but switched to one on Monday. Should I still attend the Wednesday lab even though I already switched into the Monday one since I missed this Monday's lab?</p>

Unit Test Error
<p>So I'm trying to run the unit test in the tutorial. I ran stats_public_test.exe and as expected it failed because of the assert(false). However, the tutorial says: </p>


<p></p>


<p>Assertion failed: (false), function count, file stats.cpp, line 12.<br/>countAbort trap: 6</p>


<p></p>


<p>When I run mine, I only get:</p>


<p></p>


<p>stats_public_test.exe: stats.cpp:11: int count(std::__debug::vector&lt;double&gt;): Assertion `false' failed.<br/>Aborted (core dumped)</p>


<p></p>


<p>Should I be concerned of this difference? Is it enough that it told me about the assertion fail?</p>

-------------------------------------------------
As long as the assertion fails, you’re fine.

Ubuntu Username & Password
Ubuntu never asked me to make a username or password when I downloaded it. What should I do?

-------------------------------------------------
<p>just do sudo -i</p>

CAEN login password
<p>When I try to setup CAEN with my CAEN account I get prompted for a password but not for DUO push like the tutorial shows. What password is it asking for?</p>

-------------------------------------------------
<p>It’s just asking you for your UMichigan google account password I believe.</p>

-------------------------------------------------
<p>I'm getting this prompt too but I can't type in the terminal to input my password.</p>

-------------------------------------------------
<p>The password won't show up on the terminal nor will it show characters like an '*' to indicate letters.</p>

Setup Intellisense
<p>I'm trying to install Intellisense, but when I type it into the command palette it doesn't come up. Also, my terminal somehow switched from WSL to bash, is that a problem and if yes, how do I switch it back?</p>


<p>Thanks</p>

-------------------------------------------------
<p>Resolved in followups</p>

-------------------------------------------------
<p>are you searching for "Intellisense" or "C/C++"? You should be searching for C/C++</p>

-------------------------------------------------
<p>I am following the setup guide and searching for C/C+</p>

-------------------------------------------------
<p>It just says no matching commands</p>

-------------------------------------------------
<p>Could you add a screenshot of your screen and the error to help me diagnose what might be wrong?</p>

-------------------------------------------------
<p>You want to search for "C/C++" in the extensions tab on the left. Its the symbol second to the bottom on the left (kinda looking like a stack of blocks).</p>

------------------------@41-------------------------
test cases
<p>Will we be expected to deal with the scenario in which an empty vector is passed into our functions in stats.cpp? Should we return some sort of default value or use assert to reject empty vectors?</p>

-------------------------------------------------
<p>If you look at the requires clause for the functions, (almost) all of them say:</p>


<p>"REQUIRES: v is not empty", this means that you don't have to test or consider the case where the vector is empty. </p>

How do you print the return value of a 2D vector?
<p>I am trying to start P1 and its first function, and I've encounter a problem in trying to print out the value returned as a 2D vector such as cout &lt;&lt;. Is there a specific way to do it?</p>

-------------------------------------------------
<p>There's a pretty good example on how to print a 2D vector here: <a href="https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/2d-vector-in-cpp-with-user-defined-size/" rel="noreferrer" target="_blank">https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/2d-vector-in-cpp-with-user-defined-size/</a> , so you probably wanna do something similar :)</p>

Build (compiling) failed in Xcode
<p>I'm just near completing my Xcode setup and I tried to build the stats.cpp file but then these errors showed.</p>


<p><img alt="" height="374" src="/redirect/s3?bucket=uploads&amp;prefix=paste%2Fl7f91n3gw1t5rq%2F497eacc6261e4e99aabc983c4aa1ab2eb4bef1e641bed4a59131a7ca64694a78%2FScreenshot_2022-08-30_at_11.47.10_AM.png" width="599"/></p>


<p>Can anyone tell me what I'm doing wrong?</p>


<p></p>

-------------------------------------------------
<p>I would refer to this part of the tutorial: <a href="https://eecs280staff.github.io/p1-stats/setup_xcode.html" rel="noreferrer" target="_blank">https://eecs280staff.github.io/p1-stats/setup_xcode.html</a> on compiling with Xcode. You should have stats.cpp, stats_tests.cpp and p1_library.cpp in your compile sources. Then make sure you have a: #include &lt;stats.h&gt; at the top of your stats_tests.cpp file :)</p>

Running Debugging in VS Code switches display?
<p>Hi when I try running the debugging steps from the tutorial after I press the play button it changes the screen to the following image. How do I get it back to normal? <img height="1760" src="/redirect/s3?bucket=uploads&amp;prefix=paste%2Fkt298hdldtr4pc%2Ff0827a5fe46fe39992de71f211590ea7f1b4a826cb46d4c94aaaf8ef931a589e%2FDebugging_Changed_Screen.png" width="2272"/></p>

-------------------------------------------------
<p>Does clicking on the upper left icon on the left panel bring you back to your project files?</p>


<p></p>


<p>Something else you can try is clicking the "step out button". It is the up arrow in your debugging controls at the top of your screen. </p>


<p></p>


<p><img alt="image.png" height="142" src="/redirect/s3?bucket=uploads&amp;prefix=paste%2Fkelqr7e7ju82gu%2Ff46062c98eb31b970a220ed058a4fad9cd60f3a671dcc57604f20cbfc27da411%2Fimage.png" width="440"/></p>


<p></p>

-------------------------------------------------
<p>It does but it doesn't have the highlight for the line nor does it let me continue to the next step when I press step over it stops the process and has the following output. I've attached images of after I press step over and what it looks like when I try again but before I press step over. (Just note that the message in the terminal is from already having pressed the step over button)</p>


<p></p>

<p></p>

-------------------------------------------------
<p>when you are running the code, do you press step into or step over? If you are pressing step into, the highlight will move to some of the preprogrammed compiler code. The reason the code stopped running is because it failed the assertion in stats.cpp line 14. That means the data you are passing is incorrect or the assertion is incorrect.</p>

-------------------------------------------------
<p>I am having the exact same issue. I am not pressing step into or step over, this happens as soon as I run the debugger. Not sure what is going wrong or how to fix it.</p>

-------------------------------------------------
<p>I'm a bit confused....are you saying it goes straight into the highlighting threads? The code will only stop at a specific line if it has a breakpoint (aka a red dot next to the line numbers). Double check to make sure there is no break point there. Then check your launch.json and make sure you have it set to the stats_tests.exe.  Add a break point into the stats_tests.cpp and click run while still in that file. It should start the highlight at the line with the breakpoint.</p>

<p>If this doesn't answer your question, please upload a screenshot so I can have a better idea of what's going on :).</p>

Synchronizing deleted files
<p><img alt="Screen_Shot_2022-08-30_at_12.07.48_PM.pngNaN" src="/redirect/s3?bucket=uploads&amp;prefix=paste%2Fkt0tvomb6mz1vb%2F1c1a277d597e7eb888c831a4c0ff24203abff1fbf42a78856effb38203daea60%2FScreen_Shot_2022-08-30_at_12.07.48_PM.png"/></p>


<p>I am trying to synchronize deleted files using rsync -rtv --delete --exclude '.git*' ../p1-stats/ sydneyfi@login.engin.umich.edu:p1-stats-copy/, and it keeps saying failed no such file or directory. What does this mean? Should I be concerned?</p>

-------------------------------------------------
<p>The 'no such file or directory' error means either p1-stats does not exist or in caen you don't have a p1-stats-copy folder. If you have them named different things, then make sure you change the command to be the right folder name. If you need to add the project to caen, see <a href="https://eecs280staff.github.io/p1-stats/setup_caen.html" rel="noreferrer" target="_blank">https://eecs280staff.github.io/p1-stats/setup_caen.html</a>. To get into caen and see what the files name is / if it exists, type ssh uniqname@login.engin.umich.edu.</p>


<p></p>


<p>This error could also be because your terminal is in the wrong directory. Try running "ls" in the terminal. You should be in your p1-stats folder so ls should print out all the file names in p1-stats. If you are not in the right directory, cd into your p1-stats folder.</p>


<p></p>


<p>Hope this helps!</p>

-------------------------------------------------
<p>Okay so I went back to the CAEN instructions and now I have a p1-stats-copy so I went to the top of the CAEN instructions to do them over again and when I try to use make clean it says no rule to make target clean. Does this mean I have to re-follow the makefiles instructions?</p>


<p><img alt="Screen_Shot_2022-08-30_at_2.33.32_PM.pngNaN" src="/redirect/s3?bucket=uploads&amp;prefix=paste%2Fkt0tvomb6mz1vb%2Fc985f816bd856249195c2c6b0f4c7b1bcbf53c64a93a4cdf053c8e641ae3d5ff%2FScreen_Shot_2022-08-30_at_2.33.32_PM.png"/></p>

-------------------------------------------------
<p>it looks like you aren't in the right directory. You need to be in the directory where the makefile exists (aka the p1-stats-copy folder). Run 'cd p1-stats-copy' and try the make commands again.</p>

-------------------------------------------------
<p><img alt="Screen_Shot_2022-08-30_at_2.48.45_PM.png" src="/redirect/s3?bucket=uploads&amp;prefix=paste%2Fkt0tvomb6mz1vb%2F6bfa40c2c55ff4b68cf4e49747f858ecfe6bae677df37d08234e583fd258d59d%2FScreen_Shot_2022-08-30_at_2.48.45_PM.png"/></p>


<p>It seems that I am now in the p1-stats-copy as it says it in the brackets and when I used ls it lists all of the files. However, the rsync is still not working (the synchronizing related files step) and still looks like this when I try it</p>


<p><img alt="Screen_Shot_2022-08-30_at_2.56.28_PM.png" src="/redirect/s3?bucket=uploads&amp;prefix=paste%2Fkt0tvomb6mz1vb%2F5725e490a53303ed9c20f5b80927f0d92a6940ea87230b19a85d42ef4a86aa17%2FScreen_Shot_2022-08-30_at_2.56.28_PM.png"/></p>

-------------------------------------------------
<p>You want to run the rsync command not in CAEN. The purpose of the rsync command is to get the files from your local machine to CAEN.</p>

-------------------------------------------------
<p>I have this issue and yes, I didn't do that part in order (because I was confused at the time). How am I supposed to go back and run the rsync outside of CAEN?</p>

<p>When I personally followed the tutorial, for this specific step the student brought up, there was no response after pressing enter. I chose <code>C++(GDB/LLDB)</code>, and then followed the steps, and everything should work fine. I am also a new Mac user, and I hope my experience helps.</p>

Error with checking is vector is empty
<p>Hi I don't know if this is a dumb question but why is there an error here for return -1? </p>

<p></p>


<p>Thanks</p>

-------------------------------------------------
Remember that the return value must match the type that the function specifies. Here we can see that the function requires a 2d vector as a return value so returning -1 (an int) will throw a conversion error.

-------------------------------------------------
<p>So should I be calling an exit function or abort instead? </p>


<p></p>


<p>Also another question sorry, is the count function just supposed to find the size of the vector??</p>

-------------------------------------------------
<p>in this case, you want to use an assert. This will stop your code from running, which is what we want. </p>


<p></p>


<p>Yes the count function is suppose to find the size of the vector.</p>

stdev for formula
<p>Hi, I am working on stdev function, but I saw two stdev formula online, one use N as denominator, the other use n-1. I wonder do we need to consider the difference between population and sample or just use n-1 for this project? Thx.</p>

-------------------------------------------------
<p>You should use the sample standard deviation formula, which uses n-1.</p>


<p></p>


<p>Edit: As a more direct answer, the RME for standard deviation asks specifically for the “corrected sample standard deviation”, which is given here in the wiki page:</p>

how to use csvstream
<p>I see the constructor requires delimiter and strict, I was wondering what they are. I'm working on main.cpp, and I'm trying to read in files. </p>

-------------------------------------------------
<div class="markdown" id="q38kRj58oo0ooY"><p>The <code>p1_library.h</code> has an <code>std::vector&lt;double&gt; extract_column(std::string filename, std::string column_name)</code> function that does this for you. Putting <code>#include &lt;csvstream&gt;</code> into any of your submitted files will cause the autograder to automatically reject your submission, so don’t try to implement it yourself. Make sure to check the section that shows the libraries you’re allowed to use for this project.</p></div>

-------------------------------------------------
<p>For reading in from files, you can use cin &gt;&gt; variable name. You don't need to declare a csvstream object. Hope this helps!</p>

Sort Function
<p>What does the sort function sort the vector by? is it from least to greatest or??</p>

-------------------------------------------------
Yes it’s ascending by default. However, dont you need the algorithm lib for that? Is adding a new lib allowed?

-------------------------------------------------
<div class="markdown" id="q38kRj58oo2ooY"><p>As the student answer says, the provided <code>sort</code> function sorts the vector in ascending order. You should <code>#include "p1_library.h"</code> to use the function. Remember the only libraries you may use are given here: <a href="https://eecs280staff.github.io/p1-stats/#tips-tricks-and-restrictions" target="_blank">https://eecs280staff.github.io/p1-stats/#tips-tricks-and-restrictions</a></p></div>

-------------------------------------------------
<div class="markdown" id="q38kRj58oo0ooY"><p>The <code>sort</code> function is declared in <code>p1_library.h</code></p></div>

-------------------------------------------------
But it’s not recognized in p1. What do we do about this?

-------------------------------------------------
<p>what do you mean its not recognized? there should be a #include "p1_library.h" at the top of the stats.cpp</p>

-------------------------------------------------
Yes, exactly, it should be at the top of the file
<p></p>

Hi.

Summarize function
I’m starting the project and am working on the summarize function. can I use the extract_column function from p1_library? if I am able to do I need to include the #include “p1_library.h” in the stats.cpp file?

-------------------------------------------------
Yes, to use functions from a header file you must #include them

-------------------------------------------------
<p>I am trying to use</p>


<p>summarize(vector&lt;<b>double</b>&gt;(extract_column(filename, colName)));</p>


<p></p>


<p>in main but the file will not open is there a certain methos I should use? </p>

Number of sigfigs to extend the functions to?
<p>For some of the functions, particularly the percentage and standard deviation function, the outputs can result in some pretty long numbers. How many significant figures should our functions and test cases extend to in order to be accurate to the autograder?</p>

-------------------------------------------------
<div class="markdown" id="q38kRj58oo0ooY"><p>As long as you are using the typical C++ `double` type for decimal numbers, your precision should not be an issue autograder-wise.

-------------------------------------------------
<p>When we are writing test cases are we just supposed to assert everything? Wouldn't we have to have a certain precision and do the cout.precision() thing if we are asserting certain stdev and percentile numbers? </p>


<p></p>


<p>Unless we aren't supposed to assert everything sry I've never written test cases before lol</p>

<p>0. Enable Windows Virtual Machine Platform in Windows Features<br/>0.5. Enable virtualization in BIOS (usually called VT-x on Intel systems)<br/>1. Go into Powershell<br/>2. Run the command `wsl -l -v` and verify that the Ubuntu distro is on version 1<br/>3. Run the command `wsl --set-version Ubuntu 2` and wait for completion<br/>4. Restart your WSL instances, if opened</p>


<p></p>


<p>The issue is that most computer uses WSL by default which is a knock-off version of Linux, so you need to Enable Windows Virtual Machine Platform in Windows Features to use WSL 1 (actual Linux program). This is my basic understanding of it. Hope it helps. </p>

-------------------------------------------------
<p>BE VERY CAREFULL, THIS INVOLVES MESSING WITH CORE HARDWARE STUFF1! so do it around with someone who understands. GOOD LUCK!</p>

<p>The "lack of color" I believe you are referring to is just styling.

<p>Been seeing this issue in a few places. First make sure you install Ubuntu from the Windows store.</p>

<p>Attempt to open Ubuntu. This should fail.</p>


<p></p>


<p>Then open Windows Powershell as administrator and type in <code>wsl -l - v</code> which should return “Windows subsystem for Linux has no installed distributions”.</p>


<p></p>


<p>Then type in <code>wsl --list --online</code> which should give you a list of distros you can install. You want to install “Ubuntu” with <code>wsl --install -d Ubuntu</code></p>


<p></p>


<p>You know it worked when you type in <code>wsl -l -v</code> and you get</p>


<p><br/>NAME       STATE         VERSION<br/>Ubuntu     Stopped     1</p>


<p></p>


<p>Restart your computer and launch Ubuntu and it should load.</p>


<p></p>

-------------------------------------------------
<p>This hasn't worked either. I did have Ubuntu downloaded and it was failing like you said, but when I put in the line you told me the same big response from the picture in the original post comes up. Any other ways to make this work?</p>

Since p1_library needs to be referenced, you'll probably want to check to make sure you've installed (and are using) the right versions of C++. The autograder will use their version of p1_library.cpp, so you can't just modify the library code to stop it from erroring (as your version will not be used). It's also helpful to stop compile errors from occurring when you try to submit to the autograder.</p>

Cannot create launch.json file to compile code
<p>In the setup VS code tutorial, in the Run section it says to create a launch.json file. Doing this gives me the error message Unable to create 'launch.json' file inside the '.vscode' folder (Unable to write file 'FILEPATH/.vscode/launch.json' (NoPermissions (FileSystemError): Error: EACCES: permission denied, mkdir 'FILEPATH/.vscode')). I cannot compile or run any code on VS code. I'm on a linux based system.</p>

-------------------------------------------------
<p>Marking resolved. Follow-up below or come to office hours if further help is needed.</p>

<p>Can you specify which linux distribution you're using? </p>


<p>Additionally, is the error displayed by VSCode directly or in terminal? Screenshot would be great.</p>


<p></p>


<p>At the moment the EACCES error makes it look like there's something weird going on with your permissions (what your system allows you to do with files in that specific part of your file system). I'll look into it a bit, but if you can get that info that would help. </p>

Functions calling other functions in stats.cpp
<p>Are we allowed to have functions calling each other in stats.cpp, e.g. calling summarize() inside mode()?</p>

-------------------------------------------------
<p>yeah you can</p>

-------------------------------------------------
<p>I have the same concern. May I ask something more. </p>


<p></p>


<p>In the effects of mode, the hint says to use sort, nested loop. It somehow indicates that we should write a function from scratch. </p>


<p></p>


<p>If we use the summarize function in mode, things become easier. Since we have the frequency listed, we just need to find the number with the largest frequency and avoid tons of complicated stuff. </p>


<p></p>


<p>Therefore, it looks like a shortcut. Is it allowed?</p>

-------------------------------------------------
<p>You can, but most people end up writing the mode function before summarize and the double vector situation can get confusing. You can do whichever is better/easier for you.</p>

<p>It looks like you're in the wrong directory. Use cd p1-stats-copy to move into that folder. There should be a file called Makefile in there. Run the command there and you'll be all set. (tip: when you type in long file or folder names use the tab key to autocomplete)</p>

I think the standard deviation in the p1-stats tutorial might be wrong
<div class="markdown" id="q38kRj58oo1ooY"><p>The problem I am encountering is as follows.</p>
<p>I implemented the <code>stdev</code> function in <code>stats.cpp</code> as described in the link in <code>stats.h</code> (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Standard_deviation#Corrected_sample_standard_deviation). I used the formula directly below the linked header “Corrected sample standard deviation”.</p>
<p>With the data from the p1-stats tutorial (<code>[6, 7, 8, 9, 10]</code>), I got <code>1.41421</code>. The tutorial states that the standard deviation should be <code>1.58114</code>.</p>
<p>It just so happens that my TI-84 says that the <em>sample</em> standard deviation is also <code>1.58114</code> (rounded). The TI-84 also says that the <em>population</em> standard deviation is <code>1.41421</code> (rounded).
The <code>stats.h</code> file does say that <code>stdev</code> should return the “corrected sample standard deviation”.</p>
<p><strong>So, I think that either the wrong formula is linked or the wrong thing is written in <code>stats.h</code>.</strong> Either that or I implemented <code>stdev</code> wrong and got a coincidentally similar number.</p></div>

Build Error - stats_public_test
<p>Hi! </p>


<p></p>


<p>Every time I try to compile my Xcode files (both before and after I even touched the code), I get the attached set of errors. How do I fix this? I'm a little confused because the error is coming from the stats_public_test file, and I haven't edited that one (I've only touched my stats.cpp and my stats_tests.cpp, and I've been getting this error since the beginning). Any suggestions would be appreciated! Thank you! </p>

SIGABRT Error even though the functions work fine

That error is actually supposed to happen, so it looks like your debugger is fine at least with regards to stats_tests.cpp. Can you change your launch.json so that the executable is main.exe, do make clean and make main.exe, then run the debugger again?

What to do when the “requires” is not fulfilled
I am trying to make some edge test cases to make sure that everything in P1 works. However, as I skipped eecs 183, I am not quite familiar with the details of rules for reading descriptions for functions.
<div><br/></div>
<div>In main.cpp, when an input does not meet requires of a functions in stats.cpp, should I simply make it so to simply not call the function or return None?</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>Thanks!</div>

-------------------------------------------------
<p>If it doesn't meet the requirements, you don't really have to worry about it-at least for project 1. Although not necessary, a good practice is to start using assert statements to make sure an input meets the requirements. For example, if a vector is required not to be empty, you can use an assert function to verify this at the start of the function. The #include &lt;cassert&gt; library allows you to use these statements. </p>

-------------------------------------------------
As the student response and follow-ups say, you can assume that the autograder will never test input that directly breaks the Requires clause of a function. The only place you need assert statements is in stats_tests.cpp, but you can assert the requires clauses in stats.cpp as a sanity check that you're not testing any invalid input.
<div><br/></div>
<div>Note, however, that each stats function must be able to work on its own independent of the main function. So if, for example, the requires clauses does not disallow empty vectors, that's a valid test input if the autograder tests that function individually.</div>

-------------------------------------------------
Hi! So, basically what I need to do is to “catch” the “exception” with an assert functions to test the requirement, which will return “False” if it doesn’t meet the requirement? I am wondering this since it seems like that the auto grader is strict on the format of ouputs.

-------------------------------------------------
<p>I'm pretty confident for project 1 they dont make you use assert statements and, if, for example, a vector is required to be empty in the required description, the autograder wouldn't give you an empty vector, so you dont have to worry about it. You can if you want though.</p>

-------------------------------------------------
Hi! Thanks for letting know.
<div><br/></div>
<div>I was just wondering this since some of the functions have incoherent requirements. stdev requires at least 2 elements in v, count doesn’t require anything, and all rest require v to not be empty. Hence, I am wondering if the hidden test cases in the autograder will contain empty vectors to see if we’ve accounted for this.</div>

-------------------------------------------------
<p>The autograder will not have any test cases that violate the requires clauses.</p>

-------------------------------------------------
Professor Beaumont. 
<div><br/></div>
<div>Thank you for your clarification. I was just unsure if the autograder tests cases through main.cpp and calls all functions unifiedly or tests them one by one. It seems like that the latter would be the case.</div>

-------------------------------------------------
<p>Correct. From the spec: "The functions in stats.cpp must still work when compiled with a different main function."</p>

-------------------------------------------------
I see. So when the autograder is testing through main.cpp, it will use cases that satisfy ALL function, but not necessarily so when testing individually through stats.cpp.
<div><br/></div>
<div>By the chance, what would the autograder do about the stats_tests.cpp? Would there be a staff grader manually handling them when calculating the final grade based on the quality of our custom test cases or it’s no matter so long it passes the autograder?</div>

Make clean not working in Makefile setup
<p>In the Makefile setup when i enter the "make clean" it says this instead of saying remove stats_test.exe like it should.</p>


<p><img alt="Screen_Shot_2022-09-01_at_10.32.48_AM.pngNaN" height="182" src="/redirect/s3?bucket=uploads&amp;prefix=paste%2Fky330it8gsm70t%2Fcfc7eda9bd25396ff2896e530424637a81f1b22788ebe736645bea1e345b7905%2FScreen_Shot_2022-09-01_at_10.32.48_AM.png" width="349"/></p>


<p>Then when I get to the command: </p>


<p>"g++ -Wall -Werror -pedantic -g --std=c++11 stats_tests.cpp stats.cpp p1_library.cpp -o stats_tests.exe"</p>


<p></p>


<p>This should appear under "stats_tests.exe: stats_tests.cpp stats.cpp p1_library.cpp" in the middle of Makefile. For me it just says</p>


<p>" $(CXX) $(CXXFLAGS) stats_tests.cpp stats.cpp p1_library.cpp -o stats_tests.exe"</p>


<p></p>


<p>What did I do wrong in my Makefile set up?</p>


<p></p>


<p>Thanks.<br/> </p>

-------------------------------------------------
<p>The "make clean" command removes automatically generated files, including all files ending with ".exe". </p>


<p></p>


<p>In regards to the make command for compiling: " $(CXX) $(CXXFLAGS) stats_tests.cpp stats.cpp p1_library.cpp -o stats_tests.exe",</p>


<p>think of the $(CXX) and $(CXXFLAGS) as Makefile variables. You should see that these variables are defined at the top of your Makefile and when they are substituted in, the expression evaluates to the same thing: "g++ -Wall -Werror -pedantic -g --std=c++11 stats_tests.cpp stats.cpp p1_library.cpp -o stats_tests.exe".</p>


<p></p>


<p>Both of these seem in line with the intended Makefile setup, so you should be good!</p>

stats_tests does not exist
<p>Hi, this is similar to another post about the same issue, however none of the suggested fixes worked for me. When I attempt to debug stats_tests.cpp I get a warning and then an error as seen in the screenshots (second picture happened first). My working directory is the exact same as the path in the error message, and my launch.json is copied correctly from the tutorial so I'm not sure what to do. ￼<img alt="" height="1003" src="/redirect/s3?bucket=uploads&amp;prefix=paste%2Fl7dzp4xrzjp1z2%2F8c0d97227cdc1827ee4f173d13e800af53bed27aa9e075c3c699c38740f4cc2b%2FScreenshot_2022-09-01_104234.png" width="1915"/><img alt="" height="994" src="/redirect/s3?bucket=uploads&amp;prefix=paste%2Fl7dzp4xrzjp1z2%2F56ca7c5907e17c76f10f86dc18cc598d9d4a32addf0620fd418b34ddb352d2e3%2FScreenshot_2022-09-01_105419.png" width="1905"/></p>

-------------------------------------------------
<p>The terminal is showing an error which is why the executable is not be generated (and why the debugger can't then execute the program).</p>


<p></p>


<p>"undefined reference to `sum(std::vector)"</p>


<p></p>


<p>Looking at your compilation command, it looks like you are not passing "stats.cpp" into the compiler, which has the implementation for sum().  What happens if you type "make" in the terminal?</p>

-------------------------------------------------
<p>I did "make clean" and then "make" right after (also list to show the files in the directory) and got the same error. Should I just fresh start a new p-1 folder?<img alt="" height="363" src="/redirect/s3?bucket=uploads&amp;prefix=paste%2Fl7dzp4xrzjp1z2%2Fc8645554862fdb78f4990dd34ff0711379f737acd5a8e2e8d1d00d839d4487b9%2FScreenshot_2022-09-01_170901.png" width="1425"/></p>

-------------------------------------------------
That’s a different error. It’s compiling correctly and running in your terminal (the assertion failure is expected if you haven’t implemented “count” yet).
<div><br/></div>
<div>Does your .json file list the executable as “stats_tests” or “stats_tests.exe”? It should be the latter.</div>
<div><br/></div>

-------------------------------------------------
<p>My launch.json does list stats_tests.exe under the program area, should I have it somewhere else as well?<img alt="" height="407" src="/redirect/s3?bucket=uploads&amp;prefix=paste%2Fl7dzp4xrzjp1z2%2Fbc76bd78db448b4c67501dbd5cd27f2c0bf24feca5a5127f497a6d7f79d657b1%2Fjson_pic.png" width="510"/></p>

-------------------------------------------------
Hmm, it’s strange that it’s listed with .exe in the json file, but is not including that in the error message when it says it can’t find the file.
<div><br/></div>
<div>I’d recommend dropping by office hours (you can do so remotely). One of us can take a closer look at your setup.</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>You can also try redoing the setup steps with a fresh directory to see if you still have the same message.</div>

-------------------------------------------------
<p>I am having the same problem. were you able to figure out what it was?</p>

-------------------------------------------------
<p>I fixed a similar problem by adding “stats.cpp”, the file with the actual implementations, as part of the flag-</p>


<p></p>


<p>Before:<br/><code>g++ -Wall -Werror -pedantic -g --std=c++11 stats_tests.cpp p1_library.cpp -o stats_tests.exe</code></p>


<p></p>


<p>After:<br/><code>g++ -Wall -Werror -pedantic -g --std=c++11 stats_tests.cpp p1_library.cpp stats.cpp -o stats_tests.exe</code></p>


<p></p>


<p>Doing so let me create the executable with no errors.</p>

Additionally, I checked line 22, which is where the sum function starts in stats.cpp, and there was nothing wrong with it.</p>

-------------------------------------------------
<p>Is there an assert(false) statement on line 22 in your sum function? </p>

-------------------------------------------------
<p>no. The problem is that this works just fine in Xcode, but it doesnt work in terminal, which makes no sense.</p>

-------------------------------------------------
<p>What happens if you do <code>cat -n stats.cpp</code> and look at line 22 there? Perhaps there is a discrepancy between Xcode's file and that one (accidentally having multiple copies or something)</p>

Problems with Division
<p>Hello, I was working on project 1 and I came across a problem with division. As it is shown in the screenshots, I typed 5/2 and expected the program to return 2.5. Instead, it returns 2 for this value. I was able to work around this problem in project 1, but I was wondering why the program is not giving me the expected response or if I am doing something wrong.</p>

-------------------------------------------------
<div class="markdown" id="q38kRj58oo0ooY"><p>So on line 260, <code>double h = (5 / 2)</code> is going to be set to 2.0 instead of 2.5 because 5 and 2 are interpreted as <code>int</code> instead of <code>double</code>. This means the <code>/</code> operator will do integer division instead of floating point division - you want the latter. \</p>
<p>To fix this, write <code>double h = (5.0 / 2.0)</code> instead. You can do something similar on line 262 to fix that line of output.</p></div>

Percentile Function
<p>I am somewhat confused about how the percentile function is supposed to work. Is the p input the desired percentile, and then the function would return the value in the vector that is at that percentile? If not, then what does the p input refer to?</p>

-------------------------------------------------
<p>in the wiki page it says P/100 but that's what the p in our function is, we just input a decimal instead of dividing a number by 100</p>

-------------------------------------------------
Question about this as well: should we return the percentile of number after calculation, which may  not exist in the vector, or only the one that exists in the vector?

-------------------------------------------------
<p>I think that the number returned can include values that do not exist in the vector because in the percentile example, the function returns a value that was not in the given vector.</p>

<p>The spec is on the eecs 280 website under Project 1. As for what each function should do, each function has an RME written for it in the .h file within the starter files you unpacked during set up. Those RMEs will specify what the function takes in and what it should output. </p>

-------------------------------------------------
<div class="markdown" id="q38kRj58oo0ooY"><p>Lobster does not support <code>modf</code>, among many other standard library functions. The way you used <code>modf</code> in Lobster was correct, but in VSCode, you passed an <code>int</code> as the second parameter, whereas it <a href="https://en.cppreference.com/w/cpp/numeric/math/modf" rel="noreferrer" target="_blank">expects</a> a <code>float*</code> or <code>double*</code> as the second parameter, which represents the location where it should place the integer part of the first parameter. One way to fix this is to change the type of <code>d</code> to <code>double</code> and write <code>modf(n, &amp;d)</code> instead.</p></div>

Question about summarize()
<p>I'm a little confused about what exactly should go in the summarize function in stats.cpp. Is all the information below supposed to be in the output of summarize()? If so, how is summarize() supposed to return a vector?</p>

-------------------------------------------------
Summarize returns a vector of vectors. All of the statistics functions are separate. Think of your vector of vectors as such:
<div>• outside vector -&gt; contains many individual vectors.</div>
<div>• inside vector -&gt; contains a pair  -&gt; {number, how many times it occurs}</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>Note: the outer vector should be sorted as well!</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>Hope this helps!</div>

-------------------------------------------------
<p>I am still confused about this question. Where do all of the ones come from? Where is this data come from? I know it is reading in from a file input by the user, but I do not understand where the ones come from?</p>

-------------------------------------------------
The 1s just represent the frequency the number on the left occurs.

Failing Compilation Warning Test Case for stats.cpp
<p>I just finished coding and debugging my stats.cpp and main.cpp in xcode. When I run it in terminal it works and the output looks how it should based on the specs. However, in the autograder I am failing for stats.cpp in the compilation warning section. stats_test.cpp (which I haven't coded yet) and main.cpp pass though. I'm not sure what could be wrong since everything seemed fine from the terminal, any tips?</p>

-------------------------------------------------
<div class="markdown" id="q38kRj58oo0ooY"><p>Sometimes there can be discrepancies between how your local computer compiles and how the autograder compiles. To ensure that it will compile on the autograder, try compiling on CAEN before you submit. Since you haven’t coded stats_tests.cpp yet, it would make sense that the untouched code compiles.</p></div>

<p>All exams will be done remotely, on your own laptops wherever you'd like. We will, however, have some CAEN computers reserved on North Campus if students are looking for a quiet space. (I think the form to sign up for one of those will come out a little later!)</p>

-------------------------------------------------
Thank you for your answer! What format of proctor will be implemented?

-------------------------------------------------
<p>The exam itself isn't really proctored specifically, but there are multiple versions of the exam, and it's designed to be at a length where you'll want to be focused on your own work the whole time to do well. Although we trust students to abide by the honor code, we have flagged students in the past for cheating/collaborating with others.</p>

-------------------------------------------------
<p>I'd also like to add that we have an open Zoom during the exam for any questions that students may have!</p>

Are we supposed to round stdev?
<p>For the stdev function, I know it is returning the proper value as I used cout to print the value, however I do not know how that is rounded. It printed 1.58114, however I know that is not the exact value as I tried to use the assert() function with that value and t threw a false. How am I supposed to round this number, and if I can't, how do I write a test case for it?</p>

-------------------------------------------------
If you see Appendix F from the project spec, it contains information regarding floating point comparisons. You should be able to use the information provided to help you write tests for functions such as stdev.

-------------------------------------------------
Why would you need to compare?

-------------------------------------------------
<p>I'm guessing you are asking about the comparison method described in the spec- floating point numbers possess limited accuracy. Values we expect to be exactly the same may differ from one another slightly at a later decimal place. As a result, a comparison with some tolerance for our values to differ from one another is necessary instead of an exact comparison. </p>

-------------------------------------------------
<p>Hi, Elaine.</p>


<p></p>


<p>No, I am wondering why would you need to compare floating points to test stdev? Why not print out the result of the function from your test case to simply see if it's correct win comparison with a calculator?</p>

-------------------------------------------------
<p>The point of writing test functions is to programmatically be able to assert if your function output matches something expected and fail if it doesn't. Sure, you could verify everything by just printing and comparing to an external calculator, but I think you want to use assertions to fail the program.</p>

-------------------------------------------------
<p>Thank you!</p>


<p></p>


<p>Last question, should I account for floating point "inaccuracy" for autograder?</p>

-------------------------------------------------
<p>In case you weren't able to find your answer elsewhere, your testcases that you write should account for these rounding errors in the output of your functions. But you actual implementations of functions (for example, mode), should trust that the values coming in are exactly correct.</p>

Error in exciting main.exe local: malloc: nano zero abandoned

-------------------------------------------------
<p>Are you using a Mac? This error seems to be related to macOS's memory allocation implementation (not related to EECS 280, but you can read about it more <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/questions/64126942/malloc-nano-zone-abandoned-due-to-inability-to-preallocate-reserved-vm-space" rel="noreferrer" target="_blank">here</a>). As far as I can tell, this shouldn't affect your program's behavior, but if you want to get rid of this message, try setting the MallocNanoZone environment variable to 0 as so in your terminal: <code>export MallocNanoZone=0</code></p>

sort function in p1_library
I just wanted to make sure that I'm using the sort function right and I couldn't find anything on it in the specs or .h file, so I wanted to ask: Am I correct in thinking that the function sorts the items in the vector from smallest to largest? Or does it do something else?

-------------------------------------------------
You’re right. The function should be listed somewhere in p1_library.cpp

-------------------------------------------------
<p>That is correct. The `sort` function that we give you in the project will sort from least to greatest.</p>

Grading rubric for stats_test.cpp
<p>Hi</p>


<p></p>


<p>I am wonder what would the grading rubric for the stats_tests? For main and stats, I would assume just pass the autograder's public and hidden test cases. However, what about our custom test case cpp file? Are we fine with it so long it passes the public autograder?</p>

-------------------------------------------------
Project 1 doesn’t grade tests you could theoretically leave it blank if you wanted. All you have to do for this project is make sure it compiles.

Problems with #include
<p>I have been having red error squiggles under my #include statements in VSCode on Windows. I was looking at some of the other suggestions made by instructors and students, but I didn't seem to have any luck fixing this. Whenever I hover over the squiggle, I see a lightbulb that asks to change my includePath settings. I believe this is a problem with the Intellisense feature, but I am not too sure. For reference, I started my code with "code ." in Ubuntu and I have cppStandard set to c++11 and c++ is in the bottom right corner of my screen.</p>


<p><a href="/redirect/s3?bucket=uploads&amp;prefix=paste%2Fksx7lomivv55b%2F9303439e4a18f8c1ce5442dfac8ffa6357c44b76586774e3c371e108bc9a46e0%2FScreenshot_%2811%29.png" rel="noreferrer" target="_blank">Screenshot_(11).png</a><a href="/redirect/s3?bucket=uploads&amp;prefix=paste%2Fksx7lomivv55b%2Faa0c377dee12d00545e195bb01dd411541536c29433ce6c65f3b8d3841eb66f0%2FScreenshot_%2812%29.png" rel="noreferrer" target="_blank"></a></p>

-------------------------------------------------
<p>From the screenshots, it doesn't look like VS Code is running in WSL mode. Click the green button in the bottom left corner and then some choices should pop up at the top of the window - choose "Reopen folder in WSL". Then, it should reload and the button in the lower left should say something like "Remote - WSL".</p>


<p></p>


<p>All your C++ tools and compiler are installed on the Linux side (i.e. WSL), so you need VS Code to be in Remote - WSL mode for C++ development.</p>


<p></p>


<p>(Also, if there's no option to do that, you'll need to go to your VS Code Extensions and install the WSL Remote extension.)</p>

-------------------------------------------------
<p>Okay, I’m not sure where to go from here - but to start, could you share a screenshot of the <code>c_cpp_properties.json</code> file under <code>.vscode</code> on the left of the VS Code window? Here’s what mine looks like for reference.</p>

<p></p>


<p>I’m also wondering if maybe it can’t find the compiler at all. It looks like it’s able to based on the output from your terminal in both screenshots, but can you just do <code>gcc --version</code> in terminal and show what that looks like?</p>

Summarize function test
I wrote the summarize function in the stats_tests.cpp file, so I went to go write a test to make sure it works. I followed a similar format as the other tests, but when I run it I get an error from printing out summarize(data) that says "invalid operands to binary expression ('std::ostream' (aka 'basic_ostream') and 'std::vector>')". I was wondering if anyone else had experienced a similar issue and what they did about it, as I tried to look up the error online and didn't have much luck

-------------------------------------------------
You can’t print out vectors in c++, but you can print out doubles. Loop through your summarize vector of vectors and print the output.

switching from windows to mac
<p>If I want to change from windows to mac this year even though I used Microsoft Visual Studio last year, is it wise?  Also, do I just use Xcode and only follow the main setup tutorial?  Thank you for your time.</p>

-------------------------------------------------
<p>I would say it is completely your choice. I used Windows and Ubuntu for all my EECS classes (and Visual Studio for my EECS 183, 280 &amp; 281), and now I am learning MacOS (both VS Code and Xcode).</p>


<p>Yes now should be a good time since we are doing the setup, and I think more staff use VS code so you may get more help if you choose VS code instead of XCode. But again, it depends on you.</p>

Implementing Tests
<p>I finished writing some of the function implementations in stats.cpp as well as the tests in stats_tests.cpp, but when I try to run the program to run the tests, I keep getting thrown exceptions due to the 'assert(false)' that is there in every function that has not been fully written yet. How do I test the functions I have finished writing if I cannot run the program?</p>

-------------------------------------------------
What I did was that I erased the assert(false) in the stats functions, and then in the test functions, I used the asssert() function. Assert basically checks the condition within its parameter, and if it is true, it goes through the assert with no worries. However, if the condition within assert is false, then an error pops up. 
<br/>
<br/>
For example,
<br/>
<br/>
assert(2 == 2) will pass, but assert(2 == 3) will produce an error. You can use these in your test cases to see if your expected results are actually lining up with what your stats functions are returning. Sorry if this doesn't really make sense. If you need more help, I'm more than happy to help later :)
<br/>
<br/>
Another thing you could do is just comment out the lines you don't want for right now and then add them back when you're ready to test those functions

Sort function doesn't work on CAEN computer
<p>Hi!</p>


<p>I'm running into an issue testing make main.exe and make test on the CAEN computers. When I run either of these on my local machine, they both execute fine with no errors. However, on the CAEN machine, I get the following error everywhere the 'sort' function is used:</p>

<p>Any idea what could be causing this or how to fix it? It seems to me like a problem with the p1_library itself since that's what is pointed to, but I'm not going to try and fix it in there myself, I'd probably only break it further.</p>


<p></p>


<p>Thank you!</p>

-------------------------------------------------
<p>I had this same issue and fixed it by just passing in vector v rather than giving it v.begin() and v.end().</p>


<p></p>


<p>^^ This fixed the issue!</p>


<p></p>

-------------------------------------------------
<div class="markdown" id="q38kRj58oo0ooY"><p>Yeah I think the <code>p1_library.cpp</code>’s definition of <code>sort</code> accepts the whole vector as a parameter, unlike the <code>std::sort</code>.</p>
<p>Just FYI if anyone needs it, you should use <code>p1_library.cpp</code>’s <code>sort</code> instead of <code>std::sort</code> because you can’t include the <code>&lt;algorithm&gt;</code> header file, which <code>std::sort</code> relies on.</p></div>

Set up help with intel mac ( visual studio code)
For compiling the executables, I followed all the steps but when I type in $make clean it shows extra lines like it is shown in the picture below. Also, after compiling the $make clean, I see that stats_test.exe.dSYM has been disappeared, but when I type in the next step, which is $ make stats_tests.exe, the stats_test.exe.dSYM occurs again in the files and it gives me an error message “ the file is not displayed in the editor because it is either binary or uses an unsupported text encoding” when I click the stats_tests.exe. Please help..!
<div><br/></div>
<div><br/></div>

-------------------------------------------------
<div class="markdown" id="q38kRj58oo0ooY"><p>dSYM files are, from what I can tell, “debug symbols files” and are generated automatically by the compiler with some debugging information. The <code>make clean</code> command includes a rule to get rid of dSYM files and other automatically generated files from testing, which is probably the extra lines you’re seeing.</p>
<p>When you click on stats_tests.exe in the editor for VS Code, you’re seeing that message because the editor is trying to open stats_tests.exe as an editable file, but it’s a compiled binary that the editor can’t open. If you’re trying to run stats_tests.exe, open a terminal in VS Code or use the built-in Mac terminal, navigate to the location that file’s saved in, and type ./stats_tests.exe. Running <code>make test</code> in your project folder will run the program too.</p></div>

<p>if you could upload files of your terminal, that would help us a lot!</p>

UB Check fails on autograder with unhelpful error

<p></p>


<p>Any idea what this message is stating? I've been through the code a bunch, and it runs perfectly on my computer and on the CAEN systems, but just this UB check is failing. Since it's a public check, what is it actually executing? </p>


<p>It seems like as soon as the program reaches the part of main.exe where it displays a summary, this error comes up - but only on autograder, never with CAEN or local tests... despite it apparently using the same file.</p>

-------------------------------------------------
<p>I think it has to do with the percentile function. When you put in 1.0 for double value, it does this error, I think?</p>


<p></p>


<p></p>

-------------------------------------------------
<p>This error does have to do with the bounds of the percentile function. When you run the percentile function, many new variables are created. These variables access elements of the vector directly so they have to be in bounds of the vector size (aka 0 - vector size - 1). I would suggest looking at what the variables you create during the percentile function are when you pass in p = 0 and p = 1. This can find where you may be indexing out of bounds, which in turn causes undefined behavior.</p>


<p></p>


<p>Hope this helps!</p>

-------------------------------------------------
<p>No, the percentile function works as intended even when using 1.0 as the value. Also, this error occurs before the percentile function is called. What exactly is run when doing "UB Check"?</p>

-------------------------------------------------
<p>Another thing that's odd is that the standard test for main.exe ran just fine on the autograder. I don't know what's being passed in for the undefined behavior check, but whatever it is I can't see, so I can't really debug it. The only way to check is to resubmit to the autograder three times a day and try random fixes. What does this check run, so I can try it on my machine and debug it there?</p>

-------------------------------------------------
<p>I am having the same exact issue</p>

-------------------------------------------------
<p>Hi! Sorry for the additional follow-up. I found the issue; it is not <em>just </em>in the percentile function, it is also in the summarize function.</p>


<p>For whatever reason, both my Mac and the CAEN computers allow for the evaluation of v[n+1] -- for an array of only n numbers.</p>


<p>This crashes on the auto-grader, because I assume it's set up to <em>actually </em>throw out an error when this happens, as opposed to VSCode which kinda just rolls with it.</p>


<p>(sidenote: why does VSCode do that? Why wouldn't it catch that?)</p>


<p>Issue corrected and fixed - whomever Anonymous Scale is, I hope this helps you too - go back and check out both of those functions in the debugger and check exactly which index it accesses.</p>

-------------------------------------------------
<p>Hey! How did you fix this error of yours? I just started getting it and im pretty lost as to how to fix it</p>


<p></p>

-------------------------------------------------
<p>Hi!</p>


<p>I went through both my percentile function and my summarize function using the step-through debugger, and I found out that in a couple of cases I was trying to access array value 'n' in an array with n elements, which VSCode was accepting but the autograder was rejecting. </p>


<p>Unfortunately, I did end up having to rewrite both of those functions to check for those special cases where it was trying to pull v[n]. In those cases, I actually found it much easier to just write a function that deals with that case specifically, instead of trying to work a solution into the main function. Elegant? No, but it worked.</p>


<p>I don't know how much more detail I can get into it within the honor code rules, but I hope this proved at least somewhat helpful. Good luck!</p>

-------------------------------------------------
<p>So Helpful! </p>

Why does my code fail when I put 1.0 for p in percentile
<p>I am working on main and all of the other percentiles work properly except the 100th percentile. When I plug in 1.0 for p it throws a really weird error that I have no idea where it came from. I used the debugger and found out that I am multiplying by 0 in the final percentile calculation, however that would also be the case for the 50th percentile and that one isnt failing. Does anyone know what is causing the issue?</p>

Reading only 1 Column of TSV file
<p>Hi everyone! I'm having trouble figuring out how to read only one column from the TSV file. Any pointers or hints anyone would like to give me? </p>

-------------------------------------------------
<p>You can check out the functions provided in p1_library.h. There is a function called extract_column.</p>

<p>To add on, that function basically does that for you, so you do not need to worry about it.</p>

Project Grading
<p>For Project 1, and for future reference as well. Will Autograder tell us the total score of the assignment when we submit?</p>


<p>For example I have a 9/9 on Autograder, but is the total score hidden until I earn those points, for example if there were more points I earned the next submission, my score could change to 15/15 instead of 9/9.</p>


<p></p>


<p>Currently I have a 9/9 on Project 1 and</p>


<p>Validate Submission, Cheat Checking Database, Compilation Warnings, Public Tests. PB UBC, and Stats Private Tests</p>


<p>all show as passed (the actual private stats tests are grey but it does compile). Does that mean I have full marks for this project or are there any hidden points to be earned? Thank you</p>

-------------------------------------------------
<div class="markdown" id="q38kRj58oo0ooY"><p>There are hidden test cases that aren’t run until after the deadline has passed. So you could have 9/9 now but have 13/15 after those tests run. To make sure you’re good to go with the tests, be sure you’ve tested your code thoroughly with <code>stats_tests.cpp</code> and have caught any edge cases.</p></div>

Summarize() return type
<p>I'm struggling to return a vector of vectors for the summarize function. My understanding is that we are returning a vector of vectors which are of type double. If that's right then how do you push_back or add a pair of doubles to a vector of type double? Wouldn't the vector need to be of type double, int, or double, double? If not and there's a way to push_back a pair of values into a double type vector then is there a tutorial or any information available online because I've looked everywhere. Thank you to anyone that can help</p>

-------------------------------------------------
<p>Simply add another nested vector into the outer vector and add (not append, otherwise it won't just be two elements in the nested vectors anymore) and update the amount of the nested vectors dynamica</p>

summarize() printing 2D vector
<p>my summarize() function is done and works great when im testing it. but when I run it through main.cpp and use the extract_column function, summarize() does not print the last pair of values in the vector. this might be a unique issue but has someone else had this happen? </p>

-------------------------------------------------
<p>Are you able to set a breakpoint in your IDE? If so, you can step through your code where you think it should be printing the last pair and see what's going wrong. It's possible you are exiting out (maybe on a memory error?).</p>

<p>However, I am unsure if this main.exe is even the current version of my code (with no #include "stats.cpp") because the usual way I make it is by compiling the code in my IDE which makes it automatically, but obviously that isn't going to work here. </p>

-------------------------------------------------
<div class="markdown" id="q38kRj58oo3ooY"><p>This makes me think it’s an IDE issue. Try running manually like you just did, and to verify you’re in the same directory, you can do <code>code .</code> to pull up VSCode and see if those files match the ones you’ve been working on.</p>
<p>It looks like by running manually, your code successfully compiles but has a runtime error.</p></div>

Difference in unit test & system test.
<p>I'm still a little bit confused about these two tests. </p>


<p></p>


<p>According to the instruction, we are supposed to write all the tests in stats_tests.cpp right? However, according to the lecture, it seems that a unit test itself is a cpp file with a main function that tests just one function. Therefore, when I wrote test functions for each p1 function in tests_tests.cpp, this cpp file looks more like a system test. </p>


<p></p>


<p>Therefore, are we supposed to create a cpp test file for each p1 function?</p>

-------------------------------------------------
I’m not sure which lecture you’re referring to, but it was most likely an example with only one test being shown. You’ll want to write all of your tests as functions in the stats_tests.cpp file, and the main function in that file should call each test.

RME for percentile function
<p>The rme for the percentile function states that the function should work as long as the vector is not empty, however from the formula it seems that it will be impossible to calculate the percentile if there is only one value in the vector since how will we find vk+1? Any help is appreciated, thank you!</p>


<p></p>

-------------------------------------------------
As I understand , just return the only value in the vector

-------------------------------------------------
<p>Does this mean return the only value for all percentiles 0-1 inclusive?</p>

<p>Yes</p>

alignment of percentile output
<p>Hello!</p>


<p></p>


<p>I just finished programming my main.cpp driver function and was checking the output of my main.exe against main_test.out.correct when I noticed the percentile output is somehow aligned in a way different than just outputting the information. I'm new to C++ and am not really sure how to accomplish output alignment, could I get some guidance? My output is correct, but when compared to main_test.out.correct, the output is not the same because it is aligned differently. </p>


<p></p>


<p>Thank you!</p>

-------------------------------------------------
<div class="markdown" id="q38kRj58oo0ooY"><p>Just add spaces before the percentile numbers as required to make the “th”'s line up. As a hint, 100 should be all the way to the left, while 75 should have one space before it since it has 2 digits rather than 3.</p></div>

Regarding Lecture 2
**EDIT** I don't seem to see where you can add photos in this class so if you take a look at 44:06 in Beaumont's lecture (1:30pm), you'll see what I'm referring too**
<br/>
I have a question regarding the certain data put on a stack entry. So the following photo has variables being passed into the function min(), but would those certain variables (x, y, z) being passed in be put on top of stack or no?
<br/>
I got the answer right but wanted to double check if they would create another space for the variables or not be because they have already have occupied space within the stack corresponding to those variables.
<br/>
(Sorry if my question is a little confusing as I can clarify where you need help understanding.)

-------------------------------------------------
<div class="markdown" id="q38kRj58oo0ooY"><p>I think that Beaumont mentioned before that functions normally pass parameters by value, regardless of data type. So it should be that calling a function with three variables x,y,z defined elsewhere will create three new variables on the top of the call stack like you mentioned. If you wanted this to not happen and for them to use the same memory, you would declare the parameters with the ampersand (&amp;) after the data type to indicate to pass by reference:</p>

VSCode Skipping Breakpoints (Looked at Setup FAQ)
<p>Hi.</p>


<p></p>


<p>I noticed that when I am debugging my stats_tests.cpp, one of the breakpoints I have placed is being moved to the next line, so I cannot step into the function to see what is wrong. I looked at the Setup FAQ and changed my 'launch.json' configuration and downloaded the CodeLLDB extension, but nothing has changed. Here is a screenshot of my launch.json:</p>


<p></p>


<p><img alt="image.png" src="/redirect/s3?bucket=uploads&amp;prefix=paste%2Fkv7ax0f3z386kl%2Fd8add70848e35fd1bcbcec32d1adf4b515a5f88876a6b4a98e118be1121c0242%2Fimage.png"/></p>

-------------------------------------------------
It could be for a variety of reasons. This happened to me also and it was because I was either:
<div><br/></div>
<div>1. Not complaining my code before I ran it or</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>2. Placed the breakpoint while the debugger was still running. This can cause weird errors. </div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>If it’s not one of these reasons, I recommend going to office hours. </div>

-------------------------------------------------
<p>I also noticed that when I do this, I cannot see the contents of the vectors as I am stepping through the function. Is that not supposed to happen with LLDB?</p>

-------------------------------------------------
<p>If this is still an issue, I'd recommend coming to office hours and we can help you take a look at your debugger. It's difficult to say what might be causing this without looking at it.</p>

M1 Mac w/o wget
I have successfully installed homebrew on my laptop, but it failed to perform this command: $brew install wget git tree. Anyone has the same issue?

-------------------------------------------------
<p>I'm running on Windows and had a similar problem with `apt` on Ubuntu trying to install the package `tree`. My guess is that the package list for whatever reason is not updated and doesn't include one of the packages that you need. Try running `brew update`, this should update both homebrew itself and the package list.</p>

Regarding autograder score
<p>Hi! I submitted my files to the autograder and got 9/9, but there is an error in Run, Public Tests - Undefined Behavior Checks as the picture shows. I wonder whether my score will be deducted because of this. If so, how can I check what is wrong? Thank you!</p>


<p></p>

-------------------------------------------------
<p>It is undefined whether this will affect your final score, but it's a good indicator that something might be wrong. From looking at your submission, it looks like you are going out of bounds when indexing a vector somewhere (checking index 5 when the vector only holds 5 elements, remember that we index starting from 0!).</p>


<p></p>


<p>I found this out from looking at the error output in the autograder, it should be there if you scroll down from the screenshot that you took.</p>

-------------------------------------------------
<div>Try adjust your cpp extension file or includepath to see whether the #include will work</div>
<div><br/></div>
The assertion error will occur because of the assert(false) statement in the sum function. Since you haven’t implemented the functions, and the function contains an assert(false) statement by default, the assertion will always fail and show an error.

Unable to Debug Stats.cpp
<p>When I try to run the "make stats.exe" on Ubuntu WSL, it says I cannot make stats.exe. I even have it in launch.json. How can I step through the function definitions to find out what's wrong? </p>

-------------------------------------------------
<p><code>stats.cpp</code> contains the functions you’re implementing for this project, but to actually run the code, you’ll want to compile <code>make stats_tests.exe</code>, <code>make stats_public_test.exe</code>, or eventually <code>main.exe</code> (when you get to writing your <code>main.cpp</code> file!). Notice how these three files are the ones that have a <code>int main()</code> function, which tells the compiler where to begin executing code. <code>stats.cpp</code> is just a file to host your functions, so there’s actually nothing to “begin” running!</p>


<p></p>


<p>If you’re curious about how these commands work, take a peek at your <code>Makefile</code> - you’ll notice that the three “makeable” files I mentioned above are listed out in our <code>Makefile</code>, hence why it works here.</p>


<p></p>

-------------------------------------------------
<p>Thank you! I was asking because I am trying to step through my summarize() function to see what is wrong, but I cannot do so because when I do it in stats_tests.cpp or main.cpp, it takes me to some vector file.</p>

-------------------------------------------------
<p>You can add a breakpoint to the summarize function so when you run stats_tests.cpp it will stop at the summarize function for you to step through.</p>

-------------------------------------------------
<p>I did that, and it still made me step into the debugging vector file.</p>

-------------------------------------------------
<p>Did you put the breakpoint at the header of the summarize() function? If so, try putting it a few lines into the function. If that isn't the problem, try heading to office hours to get more one-on-one help so they can look at your code directly.</p>

-------------------------------------------------
I figured it out. It works if you step out of the function and step in again. Thank you for the help!

error compiling when adding main and stats files
<p>Hi, I am getting an error which is not allowing my project to compile. I'm not sure what could be causing this. I attached a screenshot below<a href="/redirect/s3?bucket=uploads&amp;prefix=paste%2Fkp3dnvlkqrx2la%2F0bd88c4614f6d87a35be610f314706209f44248188e6e3cbd893d30ecc0c3bc1%2FScreen_Shot_2022-09-04_at_5.44.33_PM.png" rel="noreferrer" target="_blank">Screen_Shot_2022-09-04_at_5.44.33_PM.png</a></p>

-------------------------------------------------
<p>Marking resolved. Please follow-up below if needed.</p>

-------------------------------------------------
<p>What are your compile sources?</p>

-------------------------------------------------
<p>I'm not sure what you mean by this -- in terms of sources, I manually added all of the files and then changed the scheme </p>

-------------------------------------------------
Compile sources would be the files you’re using to run a program (ex. stats.cpp, public_tests.cpp). Make sure you are only compiling with only one test file, so you have one main function present at compile time. Your issue may be caused by having multiple main functions. 
<p></p>

How can you tell you completed the setup correctly?
<p>I know this is kind of late, but I think I finished the setup but I am not sure if everything is done correctly. Is there a way to tell if all the steps were completed and there are no errors (besides getting to the end of the instructions)?</p>

-------------------------------------------------
In your terminal, run “make main.exe”, and then run “./main.exe”, and you should see “hello from main” in the console.

-------------------------------------------------
<p>Yep, in general being able to compile and run your program (just with whatever code is in the starter files) is a good sign that you finished setup.</p>

<p></p>


<p>Thank you so much for your time and kind help!</p>

-------------------------------------------------
<p>Since your code works correctly for parts of the make test command, you are most likely getting this error from the percentile function when you pass in 1.0 as the percent. This error would cause the make to not finish, which is why you get a make error. I would suggest looking at how your percentile function handles the bounds.</p>

debugging issues
<p>Hi!</p>


<p></p>


<p>I have implemented all three files, and when I tried to debug, but it keeps on saying that assertion failed - if I implemented everything (including the stats.cpp functions), that error shouldn't come up anymore, right? I don't <em>think</em> I implemented my sum() function incorrectly either... is there something wrong with my code or is it something with the program?</p>


<p></p>


<p>Also I keep on getting kicked to this screen of what seems to be memory locations - is that supposed to happen? I read some previous posts and they said you can just navigate back to your .cpp files and continue debugging. </p>


<p></p>


<p>Thanks!</p>

-------------------------------------------------
<p>Any assert statements you have in your code will halt the program if the code inside the assertion evaluates to false. At the beginning of the project, we had assert(false) statements in all functions. Make sure all of those are removed. If you have any other assertions in your code, make sure they are evaluating to true as well.</p>

Debugging question
<p>I am told (for MAC OS) to, Add <code>-fsanitize=address -fsanitize=undefined</code>, for example:</p>

<p>But I can't seem to figure out where we enter this code. The terminal does not recognize this command, and it doesn't tell us to put it into visual studio code either. </p>

summarize() Function in stats.cpp
<p>Hello! I just had a general question particularly about the summarize() function in stats.cpp.</p>


<p></p>


<p>If the purpose of the summarize() function is to just print out the frequency of each element, why is the return type vector&lt;vector&lt;double&gt;&gt;? I feel as though I missed something major in the specs :(. Or maybe it's just up to me figure out :D.</p>

-------------------------------------------------
Output vector should look like:
<div><br/></div>

cannot step into function definition from stats_tests or main
whenever i use the debugger to step through my code and i go to the line where the function is being implemented to step into the function, instead of taking me to the function so i can step through the function, it takes me to some debugging vector file. what can i do about this?

Debugging main() Function Issue
<p>Hello! Whenever I try to debug main(), it always says "Exception has occurred \nAborted". Is there any reason why this is happening?</p>

-------------------------------------------------
This is the default nature. Exception - aborted usually is indicating “assert(false);” was called. When you first open the project files, every function is defined as this, and calling any of the stats functions will immediately crash with this exception, as it hasn’t yet been coded.

-------------------------------------------------
<p>It's a bit hard to identify what the problem might be without seeing your code. Try using your debugger to see what line the exception occurs on and debug from there. You could also submit to autograder so that an IA can see your code.</p>

out of bounds
<p>I belive I defined everything correctly in my loop: there are 5 elements and I stopped short of the upper bound, but for whatever reason the compiler is still complaning about there being an index 5? I don't get how that index 5 came about.</p>


<p></p>


<p>Also, the 100th percentile cout isn't displaying at all for some reason. This only happened in the undefined behaviors check, not in the general public test.</p>


<p></p>


<p>uniqname: runy</p>

-------------------------------------------------
<p><a data-pats="post_ref" href="148" onclick="return PE.gotoPost('148');">@148</a></p>

-------------------------------------------------
<p>So if I have p = 100, wouldn't the excel method itself (disregarding c++, just the algorithm itself) go out of bounds? because</p>


<p></p>


<p>((100 * (number_of_elements - 1)) / 100) + 1</p>


<p>= number_of_elements - 1 + 1</p>


<p>= number_of_elements</p>


<p></p>


<p>Let's say that the vector has 5 elements, so number_of _elements = 5, integer_component = k = 5 and decimal_component = 0. Then when you're trying to access V_k it's fine, but when you try to access V_k+1 doesn't it throw you out of bounds no matter what? </p>

-------------------------------------------------
<p>That is correct. Your code must handle this case. Think about where the 100th percentile or the 0th percentile would be in every single vector. </p>


<p></p>


<p>Hope this helps!</p>

Can't extract the whole column?
<p>Something a little strange is happening for me. So most of my functions are running okay but a few were just slightly off. I tried checking what was wrong and found that for some reason extract_column isn't quite giving me all of the data. The very last row of data is just not there? Summarize just entirely doesn't show it so I tried just running extract_column and then printing out the data using a for loop. Ended up the same. </p>


<p></p>


<p>My little test:</p>


<p></p>


<div>
<div>vector&lt;double&gt; data;</div>
<div>  data = extract_column(filename,columnName);</div>
<div>  for(size_t i=0;i&lt;data.size()-1; i++){</div>
<div>    cout &lt;&lt; data[i] &lt;&lt; endl;</div>
<div>  }</div>
</div>



<div>The result:</div>



<div>6<br/>7<br/>8<br/>9</div>



<div>(Supposed to be a 10 at the end there)</div>

-------------------------------------------------
i < data.size()
<div><br/></div>

Question about project 1 tests
<p>Hi, <br/>The instructions say:<br/><strong>"Each function in stats.cpp must have at least one corresponding test function in stats_tests.cpp."</strong></p>


<p>For my tests, I only have 3 functions (for three different data sets), but each function calls every function in stats_tests.cpp. Is this ok, or am I supposed to have several separate test functions for every stats function?</p>


<p>Also, I was wondering how the tests we write are graded, as the autograder doesn't cover that. Are they just graded on completion and then the correctness of our code is evaluated by public and private tests, or do our tests get evaluated separately as well?</p>

-------------------------------------------------
<p>This isn't something we enforce with grading, but I would recommend having separate tests for each function. With your organization, if there is something wrong with, say, "sum", and everything else is fine, you may fail every test (which isn't very informative). If you separate them by function, it should be more immediately clear where the problem is because you only fail the tests that call "sum".</p>


<p></p>


<p>But as long as you submit some test for the project that passes on a correct implementation, you will get credit for P1. The later projects will have more stringent requirements that we will discuss later.</p>

<p>"cd p1-stats" will only work if there is a directory named "p1-stats" in your current directory. If you placed the files somewhere else, e.g. "/Users/jbbeau/Documents", then you would first need to change into that directory.</p>

A few questions on the project:
<p>1. I'm not really sure how to go about my summarize function. My idea was to create an ifstream using the filename and store it into a vector of doubles; would that work? And if so would I just do fin &gt;&gt; v?</p>


<p>2. I'm pretty lost on how to print out all the data like that. Would it involve storing all of the information into a vector of vectors prior to the main function or within the main function? Also, how would I go about storing all that data into a vector of vectors?</p>


<p>3.  I'm confused about the median function: how would it differ from the mean?</p>


<p>Thank you.</p>

<ol><li>Make sure to read the provided code in "p1_library.h". There is some code in there that will make reading files much easier.</li><li>Are you still talking about "summarize"?

-------------------------------------------------
<p>It sounds like you used a constant, and tried to assign its reference to a non constant variable, which would defeat its purpose. Recall that “const” makes a variable unchangeable, <span style="text-decoration:line-through">so you shouldn’t ever need to pass a reference to a const</span>. The “&amp;” sign denotes this passing by reference. You possibly just want to pass the value instead, or make the variable non-constant.</p>


<p></p>

-------------------------------------------------
<p>Passing by const reference is valid. In this case, you avoid making copies of the original object, and "const" forbids you to make changes to the original object. Note that sometimes we pass by reference not because we want to modify the object, but because the object is too big and it costs a lot to make another copy -- We would save some space by avoiding making a copy.</p>

-------------------------------------------------
<p>I hadn't used any constants when writing the function so the error confused me. Is there any other reason why it would be giving this error for a vector?</p>

-------------------------------------------------
Without sharing code, could you tell me what line 35 does in that file?
<p></p>

-------------------------------------------------
<p>I'm adding a vector into the vector of vectors using push_back.</p>

-------------------------------------------------
Ah. If I had to guess, you’re adding the vector<double> as a type rather than an object. You can make a vector literal by using curly braces, for example, “{1, 2, 3}” will make a 3 item vector. You can replace 1, 2, 3 with variables if needed. Alternatively, consider declaring the vector<double> you want to push on a separate line.

Test Functions
<p>I'm a little confused about what to do with test functions and what data we use for them. I understand they are our way to make sure our functions are working, but I'm not too sure how to code them. I know that we are suppose to use the assert() function to make sure everything is running properly. I guess what I'm exactly confused about is what kind of data should we use? Do we use the data from main_test_data.tsv? Do we use the data from How Couples Meet and Stay Together study? Can we make our own data just like how in stats_test.cpp gives us a function where they create a vector and push back data into and use it as their test data? Is there a certain amount of test that can be utilized in one test function? Does it even matter what kind of data we use?</p>


<p></p>


<p>I apologize if this is a redundant question. First time taking a EECS class at UOM and really scared of the formatting and grading systems. I hope you understand</p>

-------------------------------------------------
<div class="markdown" id="q38kRj58oo0ooY"><p>The point of the test functions is to test if the <code>stats.cpp</code> functions you write are giving the outputs you expect them to. Thus, you should create test functions that test whether the function works correctly for datasets you know the answers to. For example, the <code>test_sum_small_data_set()</code> function tests whether the <code>sum</code> function correctly calculates the sum of 1, 2, and 3 to be 6.</p>
<p>It doesn’t really matter what kind of data you use, but to be effective at weeding out bugs, it would be a good idea to think of where your program might fail due to weird data (edge cases). This usually means making your own vectors, and to do this, you can follow the example test function given. Alternatively, instead of pushing back each value individually, you can create a vector like so:</p>
<pre><span class="hljs-built_in">vector</span>&lt;<span class="hljs-keyword">double</span>&gt; a = {<span class="hljs-number">1</span>,<span class="hljs-number">2</span>,<span class="hljs-number">3</span>};
<span class="hljs-comment">// the above is the same as:</span>
<span class="hljs-built_in">vector</span>&lt;<span class="hljs-keyword">double</span>&gt; a;
a.push_back(<span class="hljs-number">1</span>);

-------------------------------------------------
<p>The students' answer has a lot of good points. You can use whatever data you'd like to test your functions, just make sure you know what the correct output should be (or can easily find it)! Like the students' answer says, be intentional about what data you are using to try and find bugs.</p>


<p></p>


<p>You'll see 'edge cases' talked about a lot. These can mean literal edges, like a function that takes in the numbers 1-10 (inclusive) can be tested with 1 and 10 as inputs. Edge cases can also be weird sets of data that you wouldn't always see, like small sets or sets of all the same number. </p>

<p>Feel free to check out other piazza posts about test cases, the test writing process, and other bugs that students have run into as well! If you search 'test' in the search bar you will find a lot of posts.</p>

Undefined Behavior Checks
<p>So, I have passed my public tests but my public tests for undefined behaviour checks is failing. The 100th percentile just does not print. What should I do about that?</p>

-------------------------------------------------
<p>This sounds similar to <a data-pats="post_ref" href="187" onclick="return PE.gotoPost('187');">@187</a> which <a data-pats="post_ref" href="148" onclick="return PE.gotoPost('148');">@148</a> helps resolve</p>

Edge case behavior for min, max
<p>If there isn't one min/max in the array, what should be returned from either function?</p>

-------------------------------------------------
I remember that it is described in the header file that it requires the vector to be non-empty, so you won’t encounter empty vector when the autograder is running min/max independently. Unless I remembered wrongly.

-------------------------------------------------
<p>Note as well for any non-empty vector, there is only one min and one max.</p>

summarize function
<p>Hello! I'm a bit confused on where to start with the summarize function. Any chance I could get a tip for a starting point. </p>

-------------------------------------------------
Lot of good examples on Piazza. Think about why we give you the sort() function.

-------------------------------------------------
<p>So I understand why we use to sort function but once the input on column is given how do I extract that column and sort from there</p>


<p></p>


<p></p>

-------------------------------------------------
<p>If I understand you correctly, we provide a function called extract_column which does what you just asked.</p>

What should I do to resolve this issue?

-------------------------------------------------
Make is likely installed through your Windows Subsystem for Linux installation. Either open the Ubuntu terminal by searching “Ubuntu” in the start menu, or if you have the new terminal, press Add Tab, and Ubuntu. If this isn’t familiar, you’ll need to run through the WSL setup tutorial.

<p>This is after including the header and running the whole vector through the function (just did sort(data) to test the public test vector). Any help would be appreciated!</p>


<p></p>

-------------------------------------------------
<p>My guess is that when compiling, "p1_library.cpp" is not properly being passed to g++. To understand why, I would need to see more about your setup.</p>


<p></p>


<p>To start with, if you type "make" in your terminal, do you get the same error?</p>

-------------------------------------------------
<p>Just tried running the make command. I didn't get the same error message but there are several errors and warnings all about p1_library.cpp. Not sure if I accidentally messed something up in that file but would reinstalling p1_library.cpp help?</p>

Question about how sort works during testing
<p>I've been working through the project for the last 2 days and I'm almost ready for my first submission, but I was wondering about how the sort function affects how I've been testing.</p>


<p>I call extract(v) and sort(v) in main.cpp before any of my other function, and I've been writing my functions in stats.cpp under the assumptions that the vector input will be sorted.</p>


<p>I've been writing the testcases using vectors that are also sorted in ascending order like how the sort function works</p>


<p><img alt="testcases.PNG" src="/redirect/s3?bucket=uploads&amp;prefix=paste%2Fksxpu49nau04mz%2F4fb093b6b3cab5bd1db641b44a78b8cde8e3bd3aece835854ecf1079cd8b0d27%2Ftestcases.PNG"/></p>


<p>I'm wondering if this is a bad and I shouldn't expect my column to be sorted even though I call sort()</p>


<p>EX like how I am working on min/max</p>


<p><img alt="mins.PNG" src="/redirect/s3?bucket=uploads&amp;prefix=paste%2Fksxpu49nau04mz%2Fbb723a8cd7350689292922ecea0b33c1df484c3d3056bf1dc268c7e9aca87c04%2Fmins.PNG"/></p>


<p>Am I gonna be screwed if I work assuming my min will be in front and my max will be at the back?</p>

-------------------------------------------------
<p>Check out the REQUIRES clause for the median function(and other functions), in stats.h! Does it say the input vector will be sorted when passed in? If not, then we shouldn't assume the input vector will be sorted.</p>

Function, memory and efficiency.
<p>Is it good practice or efficient to call functions in my functions? For example, should I call the mean function and the sum function that I wrote and defined earlier in the code in my stdev function or does that even up taking more memory etc?</p>


<p></p>


<p>Thank you!</p>

-------------------------------------------------
It won’t end up taking more or less memory, but in terms of clean code, it’s definitely a good idea.  Your code will be much easier to read if you’re able to define it as sum() or mean(), rather than more code. As for memory and efficiency, it should all be roughly the same.

-------------------------------------------------
<p>In addition to the student's response, it's generally a good idea to reduce code duplication, and one of the ways you can do this is by utilizing functions you've already written. This will help with debugging as well, so that you don't have to fix errors with the same code in more than one place.</p>

Accessing elements of vector pairs in summarize()
<p>In summarize() i created vector pairs with {value, frequency} and I want a way to access and check the specific value in each pair. When I look up online how to do this everything says to use vector_pair_name.first (to access value for example) but this doesn't work in vs code. What is the proper syntax to access individual elements of vector pairs?</p>


<p></p>


<p>Thank you. </p>

-------------------------------------------------
If you’re looking to search for a specific value, you’ll need to write that yourself, but if you’re working off indexes, you can use vector[2][0] to access the row number 3,l key, or vector[2][1] for the value.

-------------------------------------------------
<p>Be careful to note the difference between a vector of length 2 and a pair (std::pair). If you are working with a 2D vector where each of the inner vectors has a length of two, the student's answer would be correct that the proper syntax would be vec[&lt;row&gt;][0] for value and vec[&lt;row&gt;][1] for frequency in your example.</p>

-------------------------------------------------
<p>Am I declaring my vector pair wrong then? This is how I declared my vector:</p>


<div>
<div>vector&lt;pair&lt;int,int&gt;&gt; vec_name;</div>
<div></div>
</div>


<p>When i try and access my vector using <span style="text-decoration:underline">vec_name[0][0]</span> i get the error:</p>


<p>"no operator "[]" matches these operandsC/C++(349)<br/>stats.cpp(77, 27): operand types are: std::__1::pair&lt;int, int&gt; [ int ]"</p>


<p></p>


<p>Thanks again. </p>

-------------------------------------------------
<p>My apologies, I should have also specified the syntax for the other case. Since you are using std::pair within the vector, you would access with vec_name[&lt;row&gt;].first and vec_name[&lt;row&gt;].second</p>

-------------------------------------------------
<p>Essentially, you need to use an index into your overall vector to retrieve the pair, and from there you use .first or .second to access the specific elements within that pair.</p>

-------------------------------------------------
<p>Oh I see, that syntax worked, thanks so much!</p>

<p></p>


<p></p>

-------------------------------------------------
<p>Very likely this exception message came from your old execution. This happened to me when the projects become large that the IDEs/editors just do not catch up with the latest code I modified. Yes, rebuild, recompile, sometimes close and reopen your visual debugger should help it to recognize the new code. However, autograder should not have the "cache" of your old code and claim the assertion error here.</p>


<p></p>


<p>Note: We recommend students add their uniqnames on Piazza username, so we can take a look at your code on autograder given your unqinames.</p>

-------------------------------------------------
<p>Have you recompiled since then? Could just be using an assertion from an old executable. </p>

-------------------------------------------------
<p>What happens if you run it without the debugger</p>

-------------------------------------------------
<p>This is also happening to me. When I try to debug, an exception happens and the program aborts on line 14 of stats.cpp, which is currently a commented out line of code. When I run my debugger, I get this warning in the terminal in the bottom of VSCode: <br/><br/>Warning: Source file '/&lt;my directory&gt;/eecs280/p1-stats/stats_tests.cpp' is newer than module file '/&lt;my directory&gt; /eecs280/p1-stats/stats_tests.exe'.</p>


<p></p>


<p>I'm assuming that that is what's causing the problem. Any ideas on how to fix this?</p>


<p></p>


<p>Edit 1: I fixed the issue by running make clean in the p1-stats pwd in my command line, then running make stats_tests.exe. I will pull all of my hair out if I have to do this every time I want to try to debug my code, and I'm guessing I missed something in the setup tutorial which would have handled this. I'll start looking and will make a second edit if I do find out how to fix this on my own, but in the meantime, on the off chance that this wasn't covered in the tutorial, does anyone know how to get the debugger or command line to do this on its own without me having to type it myself?</p>


<p>Thanks</p>


<p></p>


<p>Edit 2: I have a sinking feeling that I may have missed the entire Makefile tutorial</p>

-------------------------------------------------
<p>I think what you mentioned is different from the original question. If you are using VS Code, since it is only an editor not an IDE, you have to make a new exe file every time you change the related cpp files. You can also understand this as you are debugging the "exe" file and your computer helps to translate the machine code back to your cpp file so you can read the debugging process. If you use Visual Studio or Xcode, you do not need this step since they are IDEs and you may think that they automatically update the "exe" files.</p>

4 doubts regarding stats, stats_tests
<p>I just wanted clarity on a few points:</p>


<p></p>


<p>1. Is it okay to use sort() liberally for stats.cpp functions?</p>


<p>2. The stats functions start off with assert(false) statement inside them. Once we are done writing the body of the method, we remove this statement. Correct?</p>


<p>3. Is it okay to import &lt;iostream&gt; into stats.cpp? It wasn't imported by default.</p>


<p>4. Can our stats_tests methods print output ("median works", etc)</p>


<p></p>

Grade problem
<p>Hi!</p>


<p></p>


<p>Where and where will we see our grade for all assignments? Is it Canvas? If so, how long will it be after the deadline of the assignment (like Lab) for grade to be posted?</p>

-------------------------------------------------
<p>The main grades in this course (5 projects and 2 exams) will be posted on the Autograder (projects) and exammaray (exams) before being synched with Canvas. As for labs, remember that the worksheets are graded for completion, not correctness, so if you're added to the Gradescope submission you should be good. </p>

-------------------------------------------------
Hi. So we only need one submission by any member of our group per worksheet, correct?

Stdev function keeps returning 0
I used the stdev formula listed on the wikipedia page, and I am using a for loop to do the summation for the formula. It seems to be summing correctly (I used cout to check), but somehow between that loop and the actual equation code it is getting set equal to 0. I was wondering if anyone else has had a similar problem?

-------------------------------------------------
<p>Double check how you are calculating the standard deviation. I'd recommend breaking up your calculation into smaller components and checking using your debugger/cout if these components are the expected. </p>

<p>Hint: There is an issue with conversion to a double! </p>

<p>Please add your uniqname per <a data-pats="post_ref" href="6" onclick="return PE.gotoPost('6');">@6</a> so IAs can look up your submissions on Autograder.</p>

Floating Point Comparison in Mod
Are we expected to use the method for comparing floating point values within the stats.cpp, like in the mode function? Or is Appendix F more of a discussion for test cases?

-------------------------------------------------
<div class="markdown" id="q38kRj58oo0ooY"><p>We are supposed to use the epsilon method wherever we compare doubles, so yes we would use it in <code>stats.cpp</code>.</p></div>

-------------------------------------------------
<p>There isn't necessarily a file your supposed to use the epsilon value for floating point comparisons. Instead, think about it like you want to use epsilon in <em>any instance </em>of comparing two doubles. If your comparing doubles in your mode function, then you should use the epsilon value to make sure you're accurately comparing the two numbers. </p>

-------------------------------------------------
I don’t think that you would need to compare when you are writing the function, but only when testing to see if your answer is correct?

-------------------------------------------------
<div class="markdown" id="q38kRj58oo1ooY"><p><img alt="Discord_2022-09-06_00-30-28.png" src="/redirect/s3?bucket=uploads&amp;prefix=paste%2Fl7nv0y6f4pf5aa%2Fc74e8a20409ff2ffe92b39af858fe5a96026d6114f0ccef6b082c6725c751635%2FDiscord_2022-09-06_00-30-28.png"/></p>
<p>it was confirmed with the staff on discord</p></div>

-------------------------------------------------
Yes, I think they are saying this is why you need to write the tests as so. But you don’t need to compare anything inside the stdev function itself, right? Since that the autograder will get epsilon anyway

-------------------------------------------------
<div class="markdown" id="q38kRj58oo2ooY"><p>I don’t think that it matters too much for the <code>stdev</code> function, but I think that it would make a difference in <code>mode()</code>.</p></div>

-------------------------------------------------
Then, should epsilon always be 5 digits?

-------------------------------------------------
<div class="markdown" id="q38kRj58oo3ooY"><p>It’s what I’m going to use until I’m told a different value, since Alec mentioned that the autograder uses the epsilon method.</p></div>

-------------------------------------------------
<p>Epsilon doesn't have to be 5 digits, just has to be a small value less than 0 so that the doubles will accurately assert equal</p>

-------------------------------------------------
Hi,
<div><br/></div>
<div>What I am wondering is that, will autograder (in private test cases) use any digits beyond 5 digits.</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div> And , I think, it doesn’t matter in mod function. as well so long that the input is the same. We need epsilon for testing because that we are inputing a value manually for comparison. However, no matter what the actual double value is, so long that the input value (in the vector), is the same, they will be equal. For instance, if two 1.3456 is in the vector, they will at least be both 1.34560000001 or something in actuality.</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>Please correct me if im wrong</div>

-------------------------------------------------

------------------------@220-------------------------
Should we only care about epsilon when testing?
<p>As title, and do we need epsilon when camparing greater or less instead of equality?</p>

-------------------------------------------------
For the most part, floating point rounding errors only arise when the numbers are mutated. If you plan to change a double’s value and then compare two that you expect to be identical, only then will you want an epsilon. For testing, this makes perfect sense, as we want to compare the mathematically derived output to what we know to be true. Within stats.cpp, it depends on how your code was written, but you more than likely won’t need it.

-------------------------------------------------
Hi, so we do want to compare the full “hidden” digits when comparing INSIDE mode function (meaning, without epsilon) , but only using epsilon when we wanna simply test if the standard deviation is the same for the first five digits?

-------------------------------------------------
<div class="markdown" id="q38kRj58oo0ooY"><p>That’s correct, in general you should avoid rounding in intermediate steps when computing something like stdev. Epsilon should only be used for testing if your stdev is correct.</p></div>

-------------------------------------------------

------------------------@221-------------------------
error checking for functions
<p>For each of the functions listed in "stats.h", there's a part in comments that mentions "REQUIRED: v is not empty". Does this mean that there will be private test cases that will deliberately give functions an empty vector? If I have to implement error handling, what should I actually return? I reread the spec but I don't see a part that describes what to do when issues like this come up.</p>

-------------------------------------------------
In an RME, the Requires means that you can expect the input of the function to strictly follow the Requires clause. You can always double check this with an assert() statement.

-------------------------------------------------
To confirm, there are NO test cases that violate the “Requires” clause. Nothing you could do in that case would be incorrect.

VS Code lacking basic C++ functionality
<p>My VS Code does not know what cout or the operator "!=" is. It also is saying my summarize function doesn't have a return type when a) it does, and b) it is commented out (the entire function). My C/C++ extension has been installed, and I am using namespace std. Does anyone know how to fix this?</p>

-------------------------------------------------
<p>Not sure about !=, but you need to #include the iostream library to get C++ to recognize cout or cin.</p>
<p><br/></p>
<p>New: Make sure you’ve installed the C++ extension in VS Code, this will enable syntax highlighting and some intellisense.</p>

-------------------------------------------------
<p>Sounds like intellisense is just not refreshing. Try closing and reopening VS Code. If that doesn't fix the issue please make a follow up; otherwise, that's probably just intellisense running like molasses.</p>

Getting Out-Of-Range Exception When I'm Not Out Of Range
<p>In my summarize() function, whenever I step through the summarize() function, I'm getting an out-of-range exception even though I am not out-of-range. I have provided screenshots below:</p>


<p></p>


<p><img alt="image.png" height="215" src="/redirect/s3?bucket=uploads&amp;prefix=paste%2Fkv7ax0f3z386kl%2F3ce6ec8327aeb43ee723a5d15a876f7a0332267068221f70d68f656086a56f2d%2Fimage.png" width="167"/></p>

<p></p>


<p>As seen in the screenshots, I get thrown the exception when j = 3, but I set j &lt; v.size() in the for loop conditions, and v.size() = 6, so I should not have gotten the exception thrown here when j is not 5. What am I doing wrong?</p>

-------------------------------------------------
<p>Careful, you are indexing into vals with j (vals[j] on line 25). If you look at vals in memory at this point in your execution, vals only has a length of 3, so vals[3] would be out of bounds.</p>

Compiler Error for stats_tests.cpp

<p>The compiler is telling you that it cannot find definitions for the sum, mean, and count functions within stats_tests. Have you made sure to include "stats.h" in your stats_tests.cpp?</p>

Something weird happening with modf
<p>So I've tried to use the modf function and it works just fine. It separates the integer and fractional parts just fine. Then I tried to use the integer part to index into my test vector and it worked okay. But every time I try to perform some kind of mathematical operation with the number I got from indexing into my vector with the modf outputs, they give me a wrong output. </p>


<p></p>


<p>Like I tried with a vector of just 10 and 2 with a percentile of .5. Got the modf function to work just fine and it gave me one variable with d = 0 and one with k = 0.5. But then I try something like v[d-1] - v[d] and the output I get is 82. I tried with other numbers to see what was happening and it seems like it does subtract the first number from the second, but then it'll also tack on the first number to the end of that for some reason?</p>

-------------------------------------------------
<p>Have you been encountering this issue in all cases or just the example you've provided? Keep in mind that when you attempt to access an element of a vector at an index that is out-of-bounds, you may experience undefined behavior. (In the example you provided, v[d-1] could be a concern)</p>

<p>Are you calling it exactly as "sort(vector&lt;double&gt; &amp;v)"? This is a syntax error because you should simply be passing in the name of the vector, which in this case is v. You do not need to include the type in the function call as you are doing above. </p>

<p>Main.exe is the executable compiled by the compiler. It's the code that only the machine should read so it knows how to execute your program. Maybe you mean main.cpp? That's the file you should modify and then when you compile it, the result is stored in main.exe</p>

-------------------------------------------------
<p>I would suggest coming to office hours to get it check out or migrating to use XCode. With an M1 mac I would be really surprised if you had really crazy issues with XCode, plus XCode doesn't require anything for debugger setup so you can start using it really quickly.</p>

Edge Cases
<p>I am struggling to come up with edges cases for some of the functions, most notably summarize. Does anyone have any tips or tricks on how to think of them and develop test cases for them? Thanks!</p>


<p></p>

-------------------------------------------------
One trick that I have is to just think of weird cases that would deviate from the main code in your function and find ways to fix these special cases in your code without breaking the requirement case.

-------------------------------------------------
<p>Do we need edge cases for all functions? If so, would that be possible for functions as simple as sum?</p>

-------------------------------------------------
<p>You won't be graded on the thoroughness of your test cases, but it is good practice to think of edge cases for all your functions. However, for project 2 and beyond your test cases will be graded</p>

-------------------------------------------------

------------------------@239-------------------------
how to test the functions we write
<p>Say I wrote the summarize function in stats.cpp and I wrote a function that tests the summarize function in stats_tests.cpp. How do I actually test that the summarize function works? I tried using "make test" in the terminal but I only see that it creates a bunch of files that I can't read/open in the Explorer. </p>

-------------------------------------------------
So "make test" is the command for a regression test that tests your whole code, not a specific function. It makes sure that the code still works after you've made a change. 
<div><br/></div>
<div>To test a specific function, like summarize(), run stats_tests.cpp and see if the tests are passed or not. Good luck!</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>Tip: Use the debugger!</div>

How to call functions inside other functions?
<p>I'm writing my functions and I want to call my functions inside other function but I get this error,</p>


<p><img alt="2022-09-06_(2).png" src="/redirect/s3?bucket=uploads&amp;prefix=paste%2Fksxpu49nau04mz%2F55e48113b02bd2593b99e6561c45c6953b23696b54e435d8421fe721feb4fcdb%2F2022-09-06_%282%29.png"/></p>


<p>#include "stats.h" and #include "p1_library.h" are in my stats.cpp file, so I don't understand how it's undefined.</p>


<p>Can I get some advice why?</p>

-------------------------------------------------
<p>For clarification, I also included cmath, and I can use cmath functions like sqrt and pow just fine.</p>

-------------------------------------------------
<p>If you compile your code by running "make main.exe" in the terminal, do you get any errors like those in your screenshot? If not, then you're including the header files correctly, and it's probably an issue with VS Code. Could you share your c_cpp_properties.json file, please? It's in the .vscode folder. Usually, the C/C++ extension looks in your current folder for header files by default, but it may not be configured to do so on your machine...</p>

-------------------------------------------------
<p>I actually continued afterward making this post and found that I don't run into an error if I just use the function instead of trying to save the function's output.</p>


<p>So instead of vector&lt;double&gt; v = sort(v), I just use sort(v)</p>


<p><img alt="2022-09-07_(2).png" src="/redirect/s3?bucket=uploads&amp;prefix=paste%2Fksxpu49nau04mz%2Fc42af268a4f118ca7af28e03a5499afd79fef902856f0468ea324291407d4bc2%2F2022-09-07_%282%29.png"/></p>


<p>I don't understand why this is the case, but I figured out how to get functions inside functions it, thank you for your response.</p>

-------------------------------------------------
<p>This works because the sort function takes in a vector by reference. So sort modifies the original vector v that you give it and the sort function doesn't return anything.</p>

Get Return Value With Debugger
<p>How do you get the return value of a non-void function while debugging on VSCode so it shows up in the debugging panel?</p>

-------------------------------------------------
Modify the return value to be a variable and then when you're debugging, you'll be able to see the variable in the panel and it's value. Then you can set a breakpoint at the return statement and see what the variable holds right before the return executes.

Rand in Test cases?
<p>Hi, </p>


<p></p>


<p>I was wondering if test cases could make use of the rand function? Or, should every aspect of the test case be known to the programmer for debugging purposes? </p>

-------------------------------------------------
<div class="markdown" id="q38kRj58oo0ooY"><p>The issue with using random data for test cases is: how are you going to know the correct answer for the random data? If you are going to check whether your function calculates the correct mean of a random set of data, you need to know what the correct mean is. If you try to write something to find the mean of this random data programmatically, well then congratulations you’ve written your function again, or a different function that you aren’t sure works 100% of the time.</p>
<p>This isn’t to say that you can’t - for example, you could find a <code>mean</code> function that has been verified to work accurately and use that to test against the random data. But when your function fails, it would be helpful to know the data where it failed so you could study why it failed at that specific case. You would test your function against that data until it works - and voila, you ended up using a static, known test case in the end.</p>
<p>The randomness just helped you find that case by chance - but what if it didn’t find an edge case for you? Your function wouldn’t be completely correct and you wouldn’t know it. It’s better to think through and find your wanted test cases because you may have an intuition of what datasets your function may err on instead of trying to find one by picking at straws.</p>
<p>tl;dr: it’s hard to check your answer on a random dataset and random data probably isn’t the best at finding where your function fails</p></div>

-------------------------------------------------

------------------------@245-------------------------
What floating-point precision value should be used for summarize function?
<div class="markdown" id="q38kRj58oo0ooY"><p>Is it expected that we implement something similar to the code in Appendix F for floating point precision in the summarize function? If so, what value should we use for precision?</p></div>

-------------------------------------------------
<p>The epsilon value comparison in Appendix F is definitely necessary to successfully test and compare your functions involving doubles. The value itself in reality can just be any small value less than 0.01 such that two doubles assert to be equal.</p>

-------------------------------------------------

------------------------@246-------------------------
Autograder Score
<p>Just for clarification, does 9/9 in the autograder mean that we have gotten all the points for the project?</p>


<p>Just want to make sure I'm not missing anything.</p>

-------------------------------------------------
Not necessarily, you can still miss a few private tests after the full grading process following the due date. That’s why you will need to make your own test cases.

9/9 on autograder, but code won't run with real data
<p>Hello!</p>


<p></p>


<p>I submitted my code to the autograder last night and received a 9/9. However, when I tried my code with the real data from HCMST_ver_3.04.tsv, my code failed and I'm not sure why... I'll include screenshots with the error but I am not 100% what is wrong as it seems to be working with my other small data. Any guidance would be appreciated! </p>


<p></p>


<p>Thank you!</p>

-------------------------------------------------
<p>It looks like you're getting a heap buffer overflow on line 20 of main.cpp. Don't worry if you've never heard of this error before; it basically means you're indexing outside of some memory buffer (array, vector, etc.). I looked up your submission in the autograder, and it looks like you might have a problematic for-loop on line 19 of main.cpp:</p>


<p></p>


<p><code>for (size_t i = 0; i &lt; v.size(); i++){<br/>    vector&lt;double&gt; data = summary[i];<br/>    cout &lt;&lt; data[0] &lt;&lt; ": " &lt;&lt; data[1] &lt;&lt; endl;<br/>  }</code></p>


<p></p>


<p>Notice how you're looping from 0 to v.size(), and then you're indexing into the summary vector. Is summary guaranteed to be at least as big as v? If not, you'll walk off the end of summary, causing this error. Hope this helps!</p>

-------------------------------------------------

------------------------@248-------------------------
Test cases and comments
<p>1) Since there is an RME for each function in stats.h, do I have to recopy those comments and put them above the functions that are in stats.cpp? Do I have to add an RME for the main function that's in main.cpp and my test functions that are in stats_tests.cpp?</p>


<p></p>


<p>2) Additionally, my second question is when creating test cases, can I make vectors like this</p>


<p>vector&lt;double&gt; = {1, 2, 3} </p>


<p>or do I have to make the vectors using the push_back function? (So for example, push_back(1), push_back(2), etc...)</p>

-------------------------------------------------
<p>1) You don't have to but could do this if you like! Personally, I like to have my header files on the right side of my VS Code window and the .cpp files on the left side. It makes it really easy to see both and makes it so that you don't have to duplicate those function RMEs. You can do this by right-clicking on a file in VS Code (I'm not sure about other IDEs). No, you don't have to create an RME for the main function in main.cpp. You also don't need to have RMEs for your tests in stats_tests.cpp, but I think it's a good idea to write a short description of what the test is doing or something about the datasets that you are trying. Just a few words will work so that when you revisit these tests, you can quickly understand what is going on and you can avoid writing multiple of the same tests.</p>


<p></p>


<p>2) Either way should work!</p>


<p></p>


<p>This was a good question! Feel free to make it public or ask these kinds of questions as public next time if you'd like!</p>

<p>We don't really follow any textbook very closely so that there's a clean correspondence between lectures and chapters. Anything that covers pointers would be a good thing to read up on.</p>

You create both of those yourself! Keep reading, instructions are somewhere nearby where you are at on the website.

<p></p>


<p>"fatal error: p1_library.h: No such file or directory". </p>

<p>Can anyone help me with that problem? Many thanks!</p>

<p></p>

-------------------------------------------------
<p>Try #include “p1_library.h” with quotes instead of &lt;&gt;</p>

-------------------------------------------------
<p>If you're curious as to why the student's answer is correct, using quotes tells the compiler to look for the file in your current directory. Using angle brackets tells the compiler to look in a set of special directories that includes the standard library.</p>

style checking message meaning / putting test cases in functions
<p>1) When I run the oclint to check for style, I get a message saying "non-aggregate<br/>    type 'vector&lt;double&gt;' cannot be initialized with an initializer list". Can someone explain to me what that means? I would appreciate it.</p>


<p>    I did try the "make style" command and it said "EECS 280 style checks PASS" though (I'm just mentioning this in case it's important).</p>


<p>2) There's a part of the spec under the "testing" section that says this: "Your tests should be written as separate functions".</p>


<p>     So if I have a function called test_sum() to test my sum function, and I want to use 3 different vectors as test cases, does this mean I can write ONE test_sum() function</p>


<p>     and have 3 assert statements (one for each test case), or do i have to write THREE separate functions, one for each test case?</p>

-------------------------------------------------
<ol><li>An initializer list  is something like "vector&lt;double&gt; v = {1,2,3};", which should be supported. OClint might not be using the correct version of C++? That might be worth checking with someone in OH where we can see how you're running it.</li><li>This is a bit of a judgement call. You want to avoid having too bloated test cases. It makes it harder to narrow down what the problem is if something goes wrong. Sometimes two assert statements are very related to each other, so it make sense to pair them in one test case. I would say the common tendency for newer programmers is to put too much in one test case. Remember that you can write and call helper functions if want to have similar setup in each test with separate values.</li></ol>


<p>Great questions! Since you didn't post any code, would you mind marking your question as public, in case other students have similar questions? You can mark yourself as anonymous if you'd prefer.</p>

<p>Hey Guys, I was trying to test if the functions in stats.cpp could work in main but the system shows undefined reference to the mode function (actually any other functions as well as I have tried many times). I have included the "stats.h" and implemented my functions in stats.cpp, but I am not sure why this happens. Can anybody help me with that? Thanks!!</p>

Floating Point Clarification
<div class="markdown" id="q38kRj58oo4ooY"><p>I just went to Prof. Beaumont’s Office Hours today to get a clear answer on floating point errors and handling throughout the project. Here is what he said:</p>
<ul><li>You will need to use the epsilon method in testing your own code because of floating point errors. The epsilon value is the <strong>same</strong> as in the <a href="https://eecs280staff.github.io/p1-stats/#floating-point-comparisons" rel="noreferrer" target="_blank">appendix</a> on the project spec. That is:</li></ul>
<pre><code>const double epsilon = 0.00001;
</code></pre><ul><li>You will not need to use the epsilon method in the <code>mode()</code> function or any of your code in the <code>stats.cpp</code> file.</li><li>You will not have to change your math to compensate for floating point errors in any functions in the <code>stats.cpp</code> file.</li></ul></div>

-------------------------------------------------
"You will not need to use the epsilon method in the mode() function or any of your code in the stats.cpp file."
<br/>
Then the mode function will give an incorrect value for any repeated double?
<br/>
I.e. mode{2.0, 2.0, 2.0, 1.0} = 1.0?
<br/>
Do rounding errors only occur when a double (or floating point) value is calculated?

-------------------------------------------------
<div class="markdown" id="q38kRj58oo0ooY"><p>TL;DR: Because of how we represent decimals in memory, rounding errors only affect the <code>mode</code> function’s behavior when you feed the result of arithmetic operations on floats into it.</p>
<p>The root cause of rounding errors is the way computers store floating-point numbers. There are infinitely many floating-point numbers within any interval, but there is only a finite number of permutations of 1’s and 0’s that computers can use to represent them. In this context, we use the <a href="https://www.h-schmidt.net/FloatConverter/IEEE754.html" rel="noreferrer" target="_blank">IEEE-754</a> standard to represent floating-point numbers. Intuitively, it’s like representing base-10 decimals using base-2 decimals of limited length (along with <mjx-container class="MathJax CtxtMenu_Attached_0" ctxtmenu_counter="0" jax="CHTML" role="presentation" style="font-size: 116.9%; position: relative;" tabindex="0"><mjx-math aria-hidden="true" class="MJX-TEX"><mjx-mo class="mjx-n"><mjx-c class="mjx-cD7"></mjx-c></mjx-mo><mjx-msup><mjx-mn class="mjx-n"><mjx-c class="mjx-c32"></mjx-c></mjx-mn><mjx-script style="vertical-align: 0.363em;"><mjx-mi class="mjx-i" size="s"><mjx-c class="mjx-c1D45B TEX-I"></mjx-c></mjx-mi></mjx-script></mjx-msup></mjx-math><mjx-assistive-mml display="inline" role="presentation" unselectable="on"><math xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"><mo>×</mo><msup><mn>2</mn><mi>n</mi></msup></math></mjx-assistive-mml></mjx-container>).</p>
<p>While all possible IEEE-754 encoded values can be represented in a finite number of base-10 digits, most base-10 decimals can’t be represented in up to 32 or 64 binary digits. Try putting 2.0 and 1.0 in the IEEE-754 converter linked above—you’ll see that they are represented exactly and accurately in binary. However, try putting 3.3 in the converter—you’ll see that the number stored is not exactly 3.3, but slightly less than it. This is as close as IEEE-754 floats can get to 3.3.</p>
<p>Now, imagine the comparison <code>3.3 == 3.3</code>. Since the compiler encodes both decimals in the same way, they end up being equal to each other, i.e., slightly off from 3.3 in the exact same way. Therefore, even if you did <code>mode({3.3, 3.3, 3.3, 1.0})</code>, the answer without accounting for <mjx-container class="MathJax CtxtMenu_Attached_0" ctxtmenu_counter="1" jax="CHTML" role="presentation" style="font-size: 116.9%; position: relative;" tabindex="0"><mjx-math aria-hidden="true" class="MJX-TEX"><mjx-mi class="mjx-i"><mjx-c class="mjx-c1D716 TEX-I"></mjx-c></mjx-mi></mjx-math><mjx-assistive-mml display="inline" role="presentation" unselectable="on"><math xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"><mi>ϵ</mi></math></mjx-assistive-mml></mjx-container> would still be 3.3.</p>
<p>However, rounding errors start becoming problematic for us when we start performing arithmetic on terms that already have rounding error. For the sum <code>1.1f + 2.2f</code>, and assuming they are stored as floats, the computer actually calculates 1.10000002384185791015625 + 2.2000000476837158203125. The result would be slightly above 3.3, but recall that when you put in 3.3, the exact number stored is slightly below 3.3 because that’s the closest possible number in our float encoding. Therefore, the result of <code>1.1f + 2.2f</code> is different (bitwise) compared to <code>3.3f</code> because the sum compounds the rounding errors of the operands. However, their difference is tiny and should be below your <mjx-container class="MathJax CtxtMenu_Attached_0" ctxtmenu_counter="2" jax="CHTML" role="presentation" style="font-size: 116.9%; position: relative;" tabindex="0"><mjx-math aria-hidden="true" class="MJX-TEX"><mjx-mi class="mjx-i"><mjx-c class="mjx-c1D716 TEX-I"></mjx-c></mjx-mi></mjx-math><mjx-assistive-mml display="inline" role="presentation" unselectable="on"><math xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"><mi>ϵ</mi></math></mjx-assistive-mml></mjx-container> value, in which case you would treat them as equal.</p></div>

out of range error for multiple stats functions
<p>This is my code for the summarize function. It prints out as should in the terminal except for the last line. This seems like an easy bug to fix although for the life of me I can't figure out where or why it is going out of range. I figure it must be from the outer while loop since this is code that repeats in the sum and mean functions which report the same error.<a href="/redirect/s3?bucket=uploads&amp;prefix=paste%2Fksyucejru3j3rk%2F848680a0da8851c3f756e25ad8d2537c0ee9368f8c4257a613e5415ae153bc4f%2F2022-09-07.png" rel="noreferrer" target="_blank">2022-09-07.png</a></p>

-------------------------------------------------
<p>Since you're sharing a snippet of your code, I converted your post to private. In the future, please post privately if you're sharing code -- we don't want anyone stealing your ideas! ;)</p>


<p></p>


<p>I recommend stepping through some examples on paper to find this bug. In particular, what if v contains only duplicate elements? For example, what if v = [1, 1, 1]? I think your inner loop will cause an issue in this case; since (currentnum == rightnum) is always true, what will happen with y? Replacing these while loops with for loops might help, since you have to specify a terminating condition for them.</p>


<p></p>


<p>Also, it looks like you're doing all the printing in summarize(), and returning an empty vector of vectors to satisfy the compiler. I recommend checking out the documentation for this function in stats.h:</p>


<p></p>


<p><code>//REQUIRES: v is not empty<br/>//EFFECTS: returns a summary of the dataset as (value, frequency) pairs<br/>//  In the returned vector-of-vectors, the inner vector is a (value, frequency)<br/>//  pair.  The outer vector contains many of these pairs.  The pairs should be<br/>//  sorted by value.<br/>//  {<br/>//    {1, 2},<br/>//    {2, 3},<br/>//    {17, 1}<br/>//   }<br/>//<br/>// This means that the value 1 occurred twice, the value 2 occurred 3 times,<br/>// and the value 17 occurred once</code></p>


<p><code></code></p>


<p>You may want to change your implementation to fill the vector with summary information, return that vector, and then handle the printing outside of the summary() function. Feel free to stop by office hours if you need help getting started with this!</p>

-------------------------------------------------
<p>Mark as resolved</p>

-------------------------------------------------
<p>I just copy pasted the sort function from the p1 library and made sure to match the vectors.</p>

-------------------------------------------------
You copied the function header (aka “def sort(…..)”)? If so, there is no need to do that, having the function header in your stats.cpp file might even cause issues, I’m not sure. Just call it by having a line that says “sort(v);”, where v is your vector’s name. You said you wrote “#include “p1_library.h”” at the top already, which is good, that will mean you don’t need to copy over anything from that file.

-------------------------------------------------
<p>Yea you're right, idk why I was using the entire header function when I wasn't doing that for any other function lol. Thank you for the help!</p>

Epsilon Testing
When testing using epsilon, is it okay that we do not use the assert statement? In the example on the instructions, the assert statement was not used.

-------------------------------------------------
<p>In the p1_stats tutorial, it shows how epsilon should be used. For most of the test cases, usually we would do assert(mode(v) == 2) or something like that, but we cannot do that when comparing float numbers because they are not entirely precise. So your assert argument has to be something similar to what the floating number comparison tutorial did. Sorry if my answer was somewhat confusing; leave a question below if you are still confused :)</p>

-------------------------------------------------
<p>When writing your test cases in stats_tests.cpp, you should use an assert statement in each test case.</p>

Cannot Debug in VSCode on Mac

<p>I using VSCode and Mac and was going through the setup for compiling, running, and debugging (debugging only a couple of the functions I have written). I have a .exe file for stats_tests.exe, I created a launch.json file, and started the debugging section of the setup. My problem comes with the debugging itself. I cannot get it to run through my program. Every time I try to debug, a new file comes up and my terminal shows all sorts of funky stuff I don't understand. Above all the bytes, it gives a summary saying "AddressSanitizer: heap-buffer-overflow." I don't know how to fix this.<img alt="Screen_Shot_2022-09-07_at_10.39.30_PM.pngNaN" height="266" src="/redirect/s3?bucket=uploads&amp;prefix=paste%2Fl7kniuridzg9u%2Ff1af15f3b0009e13db47d608d575ec83ded72eab5c46dd9446f0d715c812c2b4%2FScreen_Shot_2022-09-07_at_10.39.30_PM.png" width="414"/></p>

<p>The AddressSanitizer error means your program is likely accessing memory that hasn't been allocated yet (for example, going off the end of a vector).

<p>it is not a compile error because it is running and compiling. Please help I have no clue what this means</p>


<p></p>

-------------------------------------------------
I believe that it means you are indexing outside of the bounds of a vector. I believe I got the same error many times.

-------------------------------------------------
<p>See follow up</p>

-------------------------------------------------
<p>I'm not sure if that's the issue because I was going outside of bounds and it was different. Also it happens for all of my functions and I can continue stepping in and it takes me to various .h files.</p>

-------------------------------------------------
<p>Ohh I'm very sorry, I misled you before. I didn't even check to see if there was an error being thrown - there isn't. What's happening is that you are always "stepping in" from the little debugging control panel, right? Instead, I would almost always use "step over". For what it's worth, when I was accidentally indexing outside of a vector, it was bringing me to the vector.cpp file that you have shown above, but again, nothing is broken with your code, just use step over (if you use step in, it will bring you to all the granular stuff that the functions we use all the time are build off of).</p>

<p>I thought when debugging we were supposed to step into the function we write? When I step over the function, it just shows what the result of my function was not how everything is happening. Thank you for your help I really appreciate it!</p>

-------------------------------------------------
<p>This is true, normally we step into functions when we want to see what's happening, but it looks like you're stepping into a function in vector.cpp. It's going to be difficult to understand what's happening in vector.cpp since it's from the standard library (you include this when you do #include &lt;vector&gt;) and you can guarantee there are no bugs in the standard library, so I would just step over to the next line.</p>

style check grade, parameter names for p1, count function clarification
<p style="text-align:left">1) If we use the command "make style" and it shows that there are no violations, does this mean we are guaranteed to get a perfect score for the style portion of our grade? Are there any other things we have to do to ensure a perfect "style" score?</p>


<p style="text-align:left">2) In the set up tutorial, we had to put some function headers in stats.cpp, and each function header had "v" as the parameter name. Is it okay for us to just leave the parameter names as "v" for project 1, or are we required to change them?</p>


<p style="text-align:left">3) For the count function, are we required to return the number of UNIQUE values, or the number of values inside the vector?</p>


<p style="text-align:left">For example, let's say I have this: {1, 1, 1, 2}</p>


<p style="text-align:left">Do I return 2 or 4?</p>

-------------------------------------------------
<p>1. You will be able to see in the Autograder when you submit how many style points you have gotten. "make style" is a great indicator though.<br/><br/></p>


<p>2. You are not required to change the parameter names.</p>


<p></p>


<p>3. It's the number of values inside the vector. Your example should return 4.</p>

<p>Hello,</p>

<p></p>


<p>Is there something I did wrong?</p>

-------------------------------------------------
<p>Actually, I've just figured out that oclint is for XCode and Linux/MacOs. If so, how may windows/VSC platform check styles?</p>

-------------------------------------------------
<p>I don't see any style point section in the autograder. Is there any place where I can see it?</p>

-------------------------------------------------
For project 1, style won't be graded, so I don't think it'll show up on Autograder for this project. But it's good practice to run the style checks for future projects!

Ubuntu Commands
<p>I am a transfer student so this is my first time using a command line in order to compile and run code. I was a little confused going through the setup and project information about the different types of commands. If I want to run the whole program do I run the "make test" command in my Ubuntu application? For testing individual files, do I just put the .exe file name at the end of the command? Are there any other commands I should be using for testing and debugging?</p>

-------------------------------------------------
<p>There's basically two steps to running your program: compiling the executable, then running the executable. The compilation commands are the ones that start with g++ or c++, and basically bind all of your source code together into the executable. For stats_tests.exe, it might look something like</p>


<p></p>


<p>g++ -Wall -Werror -pedantic -g --std=c++11 stats_tests.cpp stats.cpp p1_library.cpp -o stats_tests.exe</p>


<p></p>


<p>This command creates the stats_tests.exe file.</p>


<p></p>


<p>Then to run stats_tests, you would type</p>


<p></p>


<p>./stats_tests.exe</p>


<p></p>


<p>Makefile commands make it easier to compile your code without have to write the full compilation command. I would reccomend looking at the Makefile to see what commands it supports, because each do different things! For example, "make stats_tests.exe" will run "g++ -Wall -Werror -pedantic -g --std=c++11 stats_tests.cpp stats.cpp p1_library.cpp -o stats_tests.exe". However, "make test" will compile each of the test files AND run them. </p>

VS code not opening
<p>Hi I tried to open VS code from my desktop and through the ubuntu terminal but I got error messages. I was able to launch VS code 2-3 hours ago and read files like stats.h but now I can’t. I even restarted my laptop but VS code server still doesn’t work. My wifi is also really bad right now and not  working so I wasn’t able to follow the link or research some solutions at this time.<img alt="image.jpegNaN" src="/redirect/s3?bucket=uploads&amp;prefix=paste%2Fkt65g0odxxb5f6%2Fe285294ce2c38c5ebe6819edafbb34d1806cf69f2dec76cb3336f7a3113c647c%2Fimage.jpeg"/></p>

-------------------------------------------------
<p>Hi, I'm not exactly sure where your problem is originating from, it might be best to visit office hours and ask. In the meantime, I did a little searching for you. The below screenshot is from the following url: <a href="https://github.com/microsoft/vscode-remote-release/issues/6294" rel="noreferrer" target="_blank">https://github.com/microsoft/vscode-remote-release/issues/6294</a> , in which users were having issues launching vscode in WSL.</p>

<p>If this is the same problem you were having (which, it may not be), then odds are that this will help - it did help more users than anyone else. Regardless, I am guessing that you can open VScode without actually opening a WSL vscode window. To do this, be sure to open a new window of VScode (VScode will usually remember where you left off, and if that was in WSL, then you will probably just hit the same problem that you have been facing). Then follow the instructions (extensions is the little symbol on the left that is four little squares). If this does not help, I would go to office hours to ask for help, or really even proffice hours might be better.</p>

Standard Deviation Test failing
<p>Hello. While using caen, my standard deviation test is failing but the output of both elements is the same. I'm lost as to why they're failing and how I implement the precision and epsilon tips in my code. Images are attached<img alt="" height="550" src="/redirect/s3?bucket=uploads&amp;prefix=paste%2Fksxzjz9knc269v%2Fdc81dd1b0a490bd1b1c6b0180320c0b9041d81385eeeeda4e9531388e6ddd01c%2Fstdev_test.png" width="693"/><img alt="" height="118" src="/redirect/s3?bucket=uploads&amp;prefix=paste%2Fksxzjz9knc269v%2Fbcf80ff8191720ed50331908ed4fdb0e5ed88005adc8c4c7c8345490f7138cca%2Fcaen.png" width="1291"/><img alt="" height="544" src="/redirect/s3?bucket=uploads&amp;prefix=paste%2Fksxzjz9knc269v%2F1fa4992f40dc03f9f7d38c557528655143b0d1485a6683ecd7e1d0db304f726d%2Fstdev_function.png" width="696"/></p>

-------------------------------------------------
<p>So the reason the test case specifically is failing is because you aren't using the epsilon comparison value properly. If you refer back to appendix F, you'll see that while the first few digits of the decimal are the same, maybe 10 digits later they will differ, so thus they aren't equal. In order to fix this, simply take the absolute value of the difference and compare it to be less than a small epsilon value (0.01 or lesser) (see Appendix F for syntax). </p>

-------------------------------------------------
<p>So in this case, would I be using the Epsilon comparison value in my test case function? </p>

assert()Function
<p>Is it nessacery for full points to use the assert function for our tests or can we use cout </p>

-------------------------------------------------
Tests aren’t graded for p1 so you don’t have to worry about it

-------------------------------------------------
<p>Assert is specifying the cases which we do not consider "valid" which should trigger abortion as you may see from your compiler. For grading, yes we do not grade on your test cases on p1, but try to use assert since it is very helpful for debugging and help you to distinguish "edge cases" from "invalid cases" (Some students may be confused about these two ideas).</p>

-------------------------------------------------
<p>Assert is just really useful for test cases, and I think it make test cases a lot more simple to see where bugs where. But yeah, test cases are not being graded in project 1, but I think they will be graded starting from project 2. </p>

Well, when you use assert, if the statement inside the brackets is false, then the assert statement essentially throws an error and stops the code.

Confused on the summarize function

<p>I've been stuck on the summarize function for quite a while now, but this is what I've been trying to implement. I looked on the internet for a way to create a pair, and I used the index that I'm at followed by a number which tracks how many times it shows up. I also looked up a way to push those back into a vector, which is what the emplace back is for, however, I feel like I'm completely off track. Any pointers?</p>

-------------------------------------------------
<p>The return type of summarize is a 2D vector -- this means you should create a vector that holds vectors (the declaration will match the function signature). The inner vectors look like pairs, but they are actually just vectors with two elements in them. Each "pair" (vector of size 2) holds the number you are summarizing in the first index and then the frequency in the second index. Let me know if you have any more questions!</p>

asser() with vectors of vectors
<p>How can i assert that the output of my vectors of vectors from the summarize function is what i want in a test. For example, if i create a vector with a double 1 how am i able to assert that my function is returning {{1,1}}. I have tried:</p>


<p></p>


<div>
<div>assert(summarize(data) == {{1,1}});</div>
</div>


<div><br/>but am receiving the error:
<p><b>initializer list cannot be used on the right hand</b></p>
<p><b>      side of operator '=='</b></p>
<p>  assert(summarize(data) == {{1,1}});</p>
</div>


<p></p>


<p></p>

-------------------------------------------------
<p>I would recommend creating a vector with that initializer list and then comparing the return value of summarize against the vector you create of your expected output.</p>

-------------------------------------------------
<p>An invalid read typically indicates that you are attempting to access something at an index that is out-of-bounds on your vector/array.

Segmentation fault error when testing on HCMST file

Everything works fine when I run it using the main_test_data.tsv and I have the sanitiser line in my makefile, so I'm confused. Thanks!</p>


<p></p>


<p><img alt="Screen_Shot_2022-09-08_at_8.37.40_PM.pngNaN" src="/redirect/s3?bucket=uploads&amp;prefix=paste%2Fkegpb635x7o4rj%2F7bf368dbc23efec68198cbf6f1fe0386e114fa369e4315d3f7fc0731d43cc05d%2FScreen_Shot_2022-09-08_at_8.37.40_PM.png"/></p>

-------------------------------------------------
<p>Segmentation faults can mean a lot of things (typically with accessing outside of a bound) so you would have to dig into your code and see what might be wrong. I recommend making a private post or coming to office hours. That being said, for this project, typically segmentation faults could occur if you are accessing outside the space of a vector. So I suggest you make sure you are accessing elements that exist within the vector objects you are creating (keep track of the running size of the vector to verify this).</p>

What to return for percentile.
<p>Hi, for the percentile function I was wondering if we are asking the user for a specific percentile and printing that or if we are just printing 0,25,50,75,100 like in the example, thanks.</p>

-------------------------------------------------
Your main function should use those set percentiles, but your percentile function should be able to handle any given percentile. For this project, we are basically submitting the functions in stats.cpp, so the autograder will input vectors and percentiles and test the output. In other words, no cout or cin needed.

-------------------------------------------------
<p>So the function takes "v" and "p" as input, so if we are not asking the user for the percentile what would our input for p be then?</p>

-------------------------------------------------
<p>The percentile function should be able to handle any value p, but for the purposes of this project you only need to test p = 0, 0.25, 0.5, 0.75, 1.0 from main (you don't need to ask the user to input a percentile). </p>

-------------------------------------------------
<p>It looks like your code never completes running. So somewhere between lines 26 and 29 it is getting "stuck", and never makes it to line 30, which is why we don't see that output at the terminal. You could try setting a breakpoint at line 26 and using the debugger to see where in the code the program is getting stuck.</p>

Addressing bullets 3,4, and 5, instructor should correct me if I’m wrong, but in project 1, they are not testing our test cases, there are just certain tests that will be performed on our functions.
<div><br/></div>
<div>Like, if you had an add function, they might test it by giving it 1 and 6 to get 7, and then another with 4 and -1, to test if the function can handle this. You do not *need* to write test cases specifically (for this project, again, instructor should correct me if I’m wrong), you *should* write them to help convince yourself that your function will pass any test the autograder forces it through. </div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>The list of private tests on the autograder I believe is a heads up to us as students about how many ways they will be testing our functions, and their titles give you a hint on how vulnerable certain functions are (for instance, a more complex function will have more vulnerability to error, most of the time, so there will be more tests of it, because there are more possible bugs).</div>

<div>Use these titled tests to help assure yourself that you have covered all your bases. These grayed out boxes, however, will not highlight until after the final due date for the project.</div>

<div class="markdown" id="q38kRj58oo0ooY"><p>I have the “WSL - Remote extension” installed in VS code. Is there a different extension that I need to have installed?</p></div>

-------------------------------------------------
<p dir="ltr">I had the same issue. Did you install the debian file from<a href="https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/setup/linux" rel="noreferrer" target="_blank"> here</a>? It looks like you are running windows which means you don't need to install the linux vscode version even though we are using WSL.  If I remember correctly the command to entirely uinstall the debian file is: $sudo apt purge &lt;filename&gt;.deb </p>


<p dir="ltr">If you already have the windows version of VScode installed, once you remove the debian file and run $code . it should open the windows vscode version and on the bottom left you'll see "WSL: Ubuntu" in the green box. Otherwise just install windows vscode from <a href="https://code.visualstudio.com/" rel="noreferrer" target="_blank">here </a>and it should work</p>

<p>Try closing and reopening the terminal as well. Sometimes the issue just turns out to be that the terminal needs to reload after VS Code was installed.</p>

Almost all commands not found after trying to add PATH to VSCode
<p>I have tried to follow the setup a few times, and even went to the professor office hours, but I could not use the "code ." command to open VSCode from the terminal. Thus, I tried to add a path command to the nano editor, and now all (or at least most) of the commands from the tutorial are not working, and I am assuming I messed up my PATH variable. Is there a way to just reset all of the things I have done so I can try and follow the tutorial from scratch? </p>


<p></p>


<p>Edit: Resolved by removing .zshrc file PATH command and then using shell command: Installing code in PATH on VS Code.</p>

bad_alloc error on summarize function [w/ image]

<p>This is my implementation of the summarize function in stats.cpp. This screenshot also has the error that I get after trying to run stats_tests.</p>

-------------------------------------------------
<div class="markdown" id="q38kRj58oo0ooY"><p>Hmm okay. Looking at <code>summarize</code> in <code>stats.cpp</code>, you’re probably getting that specific issue on line 23 or line 28. <code>bigv[1]</code> refers to the second element of <code>bigv</code>, but <code>bigv</code> only has one element (one vector) in it on the first iteration of the for loop.</p>
<p>I <em>think</em> (and I could be wrong) that you might be mixing things up with your vector indexes. If so, this might help. We provide an example in <code>stats.h</code> of an output summarize vector like so:</p>
<pre><code>{
    {1, 2},
    {2, 3},
    {17, 1}
}
</code></pre><p>The entire object is of type <code>vector&lt;vector&lt;double&gt;&gt;</code>. There are three <code>vector&lt;double&gt;</code> objects in here: <code>{1, 2}</code>, <code>{2, 3}</code>, <code>{17, 1}</code>. If we call our outer vector of vectors <code>v</code>, then we could access the second vector with <code>v[1]</code>. We can then index into the vector at <code>v[1]</code> with additional square brackets: <code>v[1][0] == 2</code> (first element of <code>v[1]</code>) and <code>v[1][1] == 3</code> (second element of <code>v[2]</code>). Going back a bit, <code>v[0]</code> accesses the first vector, `v[2] accesses the third vector.</p>
<p>I may have misdiagnosed the issue, so please follow up (or hop on office hours!) if this isn’t clear and/or you’d like more assistance.</p></div>

-------------------------------------------------
<p>Ok I think I understand what you mean somewhat about indexing into the vectors. Also I would go to office hours but I have class during that time today :( I'm still somewhat unsure on my approach but that aside, I don't understand why there is an error on lines 24/25. It says "expression must have class type but it has type "double"C/C++(153)" but I feel like since I am indexing into the vector of doubles and then into the double cell itself, I should be able to push back a double. Why wouldn't this work? <img alt="Screen_Shot_2022-09-09_at_12.19.01_PM.png" src="/redirect/s3?bucket=uploads&amp;prefix=paste%2Fkswhs7lnsj31vn%2Fea6449e8fa3507e579cb9f5767dfcae1a12fed12e03a5a136a89b010e85ceec6%2FScreen_Shot_2022-09-09_at_12.19.01_PM.png"/></p>

-------------------------------------------------
<p>You have the right idea on line 18 where you push a vector into your bigV. You're going to want to mirror that on lines 24-25. The reason its giving you an error is because bigV is a vector of vectors so it will only allow you to push another vector into it, not individual double values. </p>

Autograder Undefined Behavior Check
<p>Hi, I got 9/9 on the autograder, but my code isn't passing the "main public test" undefined behavior check. For some reason, my output when I submit files to the autograder doesn't match the output when I run my code in my terminal. As you can (hopefully) see in the attached image, my student output in the autograder doesn't include the "100th percentile" line even though it's included in my terminal output. I'm wondering if failing this undefined behavior check will affect my grade/my ability to pass the private tests in any way? And if so, how do I make the autograder output match my terminal output? <img alt="" height="964" src="/redirect/s3?bucket=uploads&amp;prefix=paste%2Fksx8wzxsmtjif%2F549ce7f6abb7d13d7a8569d4bb28ad53cb2fa115bae8651534d9c458159ebd9d%2FScreen_Shot_2022-09-09_at_11.24.56_AM.png" width="886"/></p>

-------------------------------------------------
<div class="markdown" id="q38kRj58oo0ooY"><p>My guess is that the code is able to run up to 75th percentile, but crashes before it can finish running and print 100th percentile. Take a look at your percentile implementation again and see if maybe you’re hitting an edge case on the 100th percentile case (in particular, indexing out of bounds).</p></div>

Summarize Tests
<p>I'm a bit confused on how to actually test summarize as assert is only for one value? Are we supposed to split up the tests or see if the 2D vectors match? </p>

-------------------------------------------------
<p>Assert can be used for vector equality, though I believe you might have to declare them before putting them in the statement:</p>



<div>vector&lt;vector&lt;int&gt;&gt; example = {{1,2},{3,1}};</div>


<div>assert(summary(data) == example);</div>



<div>Assert is a function that tests if the internal statement is true or false, so you can test whatever you want in it.</div>

Out of Bounds Error But Not Sure where it is stemming from
<p>Hello! I submitted my files in the autograder and got 9/9 on my tests but I keep failing the public test. It keeps showing me an error saying out of bounds and I thought it would be in the percentile or summarize function, but I have no idea where this issue is stemming from. Some insight would be appreciated.</p>

-------------------------------------------------
<p>Hi! This is a great question. On the autograder, your test functions are tested against other buggy code to see if you catch errors. Unfortunately, getting all of the test points on autograder doesn't mean your code actually passes them. You'd have to run your stats_tests.cpp locally to test your code. </p>


<p></p>


<p>I think you're right on track in terms of looking for where the errors could be. In particular, I'd take a closer look at the spec for each of these functions. In particular, take note if the spec mentions anything about where your functions should start indexing from. </p>


<p></p>


<p>This is a great question, and I think other students could benefit from seeing it. If you feel comfortable, feel free to make it public! You can still choose to keep it anonymous. Hope this helps!</p>

-------------------------------------------------
<p>Hi so I think my question may have been misunderstood. My code passes all my private stats tests and the public ones through the auto grader but the two it fails are because of out of bounds indexes. I accounted for the different indexes while coding the percentile and summarize function but still receive that error so I was wondering if someone could take a look at my attached functions and let me know if I am missing something there or did something wrong causing the error in the auto grader. </p>

-------------------------------------------------
<p>Try taking a look in your percentile function and step through it with the extreme ends of percentile like the 0th percentile and 100th percentile. Particularly, you're going to want to look at each time you call v[something] check that in all cases that something is going to be strictly less than the size of your vector. </p>

-------------------------------------------------
<p>Am I not accounting for that already though? In my current percentile function, I made if statements and else if statements to account for when v[something] has a negative number or something out of bounds.<a href="/redirect/s3?bucket=uploads&amp;prefix=paste%2Fksxzjz9knc269v%2F1f00a9cd595a380821f5650c7e38629e9e469f8c0709c92215e9d8f6f97bee76%2F1.png" rel="noreferrer" target="_blank">1.png</a></p>

-------------------------------------------------
You have if statements to check if intpart is equal to 0 or equal to 1. But think about the errors you're getting. It's saying you're trying to index 3th element in a size of 3 vector which is out of bounds. When would your intpart be large enough to be the size of the vector?

-------------------------------------------------
<p>You may have updated the question since the instructor response was made, but I just wanted to clarify that since your post included an image of the code you wrote, this was an appropriate use of marking the question private 👍. </p>

-------------------------------------------------
<p>Yup! It was private to begin with, just to make sure I don't violate the honor code.</p>

-------------------------------------------------

------------------------@306-------------------------
Percentage requirements
<p>The percentage function only has the requirement that v is not empty, but I am not sure if I am reading / implementing percentage wrong from the Wikipedia, but it seems to me to need 2 elements to give a percentage? I am just making sure so I can find all the edge cases based on what is given</p>

-------------------------------------------------
<p>Yes you will need both values that are passed in as parameters for the function. The requires clause in the RME is not detailing what the function takes in to operate, but rather prerequisites of the values to ensure that the function works correctly. For example, in this case, it is simply telling you that the function should only work given that the vector v that is passed in is not empty. Think about how you can use an assert statement to ensure that the requires clause is being met. </p>

Creating vector reading input in main.cpp
<p>I'm a little confused on how to create a vector based on the file that is inputted into the extract_column function. How do I translate their input of a string into my cin command into a vector of values that I can use in the parameters for the rest of my stats functions?</p>

-------------------------------------------------
<div class="markdown" id="q38kRj58oo0ooY"><p><code>extract_column</code> function takes a filename and a column name as inputs and returns a vector. The vector contains the data you will input into the functions in <code>stats.cpp</code>. I suggest you try the <code>extract_column</code> function by calling it and inspecting its output.</p></div>

uncaught exception of type std::invalid_argument: stod: no conversion
<p>I have individually tested all of my functions using tests I have made and they seem to work. I then ran my main function and it spit out an error. This also happens when I run make test. The error is below:</p>


<p></p>


<p>./main.exe &lt; main_test.in &gt; main_test.out<br/>libc++abi: terminating with uncaught exception of type std::invalid_argument: stod: no conversion<br/>/bin/sh: line 1: 97900 Abort trap: 6           ./main.exe &lt; main_test.in &gt; main_test.out<br/>make: *** [test] Error 134</p>


<p></p>


<p>The "invalid_argument" seems like something I would get if I was using "int" instead of "size_t" for for loops, but I went through and verified I was in fact using "size_t" in all of the loops. What sort of issue with my code should I be looking for in this situation?</p>

-------------------------------------------------
<div class="markdown" id="q38kRj58oo0ooY"><p>Are you using the <code>stod</code> function? It will throw an <code>invalid_argument</code> exception if the string cannot be converted into a double.</p>
<p>For reference: <a href="https://cplusplus.com/reference/string/stod/" target="_blank">https://cplusplus.com/reference/string/stod/</a></p></div>

-------------------------------------------------
<p>I am not. Is that something I should be using?</p>

-------------------------------------------------
<div class="markdown" id="q38kRj58oo1ooY"><p>I see. This is used in the <code>extract_column</code> function which you shouldn’t worry about. Did you modify the input data (<code>main_test_data.tsv</code>) or the input file <code>main_test.in</code>?</p></div>

-------------------------------------------------
<p>Not that I remember, also I ran it through the auto grader and everything works perfectly except my 100th percentile line does not print for some reason. I don't know why this is because if I run the exact same numbers through the function in a test, the 100th percentile line prints.</p>

-------------------------------------------------
<div class="markdown" id="q38kRj58oo2ooY"><p>I’ve looked at your code on Autograder. Your <code>percentile</code> function did not work for the case where <code>p=1</code>. That’s why it shows you the error. You can look at the error output, it says something like “out-of-bounds”. I suggest you double-check your code in the <code>percentile</code> function carefully and think about the special cases.</p></div>

-------------------------------------------------
<p>I got it! Thank you, I still don't know why what I found to be the problem didn't show up in my test cases though.</p>

-------------------------------------------------

As long as you're not looking at any code together (other than the starter code), that's fine

Mode function
<p>I'm trying to use the summarize function in my mode function. Is there a way I can access the variables in the summarize function within the mode function?</p>

Not as far as I am aware, the variables within the summary function are not in the scope of the mode function. Personally would recommend just writing a mode function independent of summary.

-------------------------------------------------
<p>Have you used #include "stats.h" at the top of this file?</p>

-------------------------------------------------
<p> When you have "( )", that usually indicates a function. Remember that the inputs to these functions are vectors. You're getting this error because a vector is expected, but there's a function as input instead. Remove the parentheses next to the vector names and that should remove the error.</p>

-------------------------------------------------
<p>yeah i have not sure why its saying that</p>

-------------------------------------------------
Maybe try just manually inputting a vector, for instance:
<div><br/></div>
<div>vector&lt;int&gt; example = {1,2,3};</div>
<div>double mean = mean(example);</div>
<div><br/></div>

<p>Hi! I'm getting this error in my summarize function when I create a new vector of doubles and set it equal to {current num in for loop, count} and I'm not sure how to fix it.<br/> "message": "Non-aggregate type 'vector&lt;double&gt;' cannot be initialized with an initializer list".</p>

-------------------------------------------------
<div class="markdown" id="q38kRj58oo0ooY"><p>Did you initialize the vector outside of the loop? I recognize that error from when someone tried doing <code>assert(summary(data) == {{1,1},{2,1}});</code>, and the solution was to initialize this double vector outside of the assert statement. I would recommend creating a 1D vector outside of the loop, pushing back to a 2D vector and then overwriting it, rather than initializing it each time within the loop, if that is what you are doing. My guess is that that is where the error is coming from. If it wasn’t that, maybe these: did you type <code>vector&lt;double&gt; = {current_num, count};</code>, or <code>vector&lt;double&gt; example_name = {current_num, count};</code> (<code>int</code> vs <code>double</code> not relevant here)? Maybe try initializing it with an actual number then use your variables. Hope this helps!!! 😃</p></div>

-------------------------------------------------
<p>Maybe try refreshing (I know in VScode there is a little refresh icon, not sure for xcode)? You can use the makefile's commands to try the following as well:</p>


<p>make clean</p>


<p>make test</p>


<p></p>


<p>or instead of make test:</p>


<p>make stats_test.exe</p>


<p>./stats_test.exe</p>

-------------------------------------------------
<div class="markdown" id="q38kRj58oo0ooY"><p>Adding on to the student’s answer. Make sure to always recompile your source file before running it or using the debugger. The <code>make</code> command will help you compile all the associated source files and create an executable file for you to run.</p></div>

Caen Help
<p>Hi, </p>


<p></p>


<p>I was wondering whether installing CAEN Linux was necessary for project 1. I submitted to the autograder and got full points without using CAEN.</p>


<p></p>


<p>I also am confused as to how to login to CAEN and how it is used with a Mac. If someone could help explain the purpose of CAEN also that would be really helpful. </p>


<p></p>


<p>Thanks!</p>

-------------------------------------------------
The reason we use CAEN is because the autograder runs on an environment very similar to CAEN. There are times where a program may work on your local machine but won't work on the autograder and CAEN. It exposes certain other issues with code like undefined behavior. 
<div><br/></div>
<div>I just want to clarify that even though you got full points on the public cases on the Autograder, does not mean your code is working perfectly. You should definitely write your own test cases and run your code in CAEN to ensure that you don't have any bugs. The test cases on the autograder are very basic and do not encompass all edge cases. </div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>There's a CAEN tutorial on the eecs 280 website that will be helpful for how to navigate CAEN on mac! </div>

percentile() return value when only one value is in a vector
<p>I know a question like this was already answered, but going off of that, do we have the function just return that one value for any and all percentiles 0-1 inclusive, or just 0 and 1?</p>


<p></p>


<p>Thank you in advance.</p>

Inclusive works

auto grader problem
<p>Hi guys. I submitted my files in autograder and the main public test case failed. From my point of view, I cannot find what is the difference. Anyone can help?</p>

-------------------------------------------------
This is a white space issue. You should not be printing spaces after the highlighted statements.

-------------------------------------------------
There's an option on the autograder to show white space and you can see exactly where there should be a space (denoted by a dot) and where there should be a new line (denoted by an arrow)

error involving using count function
<p>Hello, so I submitted my code to the auto grader and I got this error:</p>


<p></p>


<p>stats.cpp: In function 'std::vector&lt;std::vector&lt;double&gt; &gt; summarize(std::vector&lt;double&gt;)':<br/>stats.cpp:34:23: error: could not convert 'value.std::vector&lt;_Tp, _Alloc&gt;::begin&lt;int, std::allocator&lt;int&gt; &gt;()' from 'std::vector&lt;int&gt;::iterator {aka __gnu_cxx::__normal_iterator&lt;int*, std::vector&lt;int&gt; &gt;}' to 'std::vector&lt;double&gt;'<br/> if(!(count(value.begin(),value.end(),v.at(i)))){<br/>                       ^<br/>stats.cpp:38:35: error: could not convert 'v.std::vector&lt;_Tp, _Alloc&gt;::begin&lt;double, std::allocator&lt;double&gt; &gt;()' from 'std::vector&lt;double&gt;::iterator {aka __gnu_cxx::__normal_iterator&lt;double*, std::vector&lt;double&gt; &gt;}' to 'std::vector&lt;double&gt;'<br/> frequency.push_back((count(v.begin(),v.end(),v.at(i))));</p>


<p></p>


<p></p>


<p>Could someone please help me understand what it means? For extra context as to what the count() function in this instance is see this article: <a href="https://cplusplus.com/reference/algorithm/count/" rel="noreferrer" target="_blank">https://cplusplus.com/reference/algorithm/count/</a> </p>


<p></p>


<p>I believe it is confusing the count function I am using from the website to the one we have to code for this project. Is there any way to avoid that? </p>


<p></p>

-------------------------------------------------
This function is within the <algorithm> library which is unfortunately not part of the allowed libraries in this project. 
<div>I would recommend implementing the summarize function manually. </div>

Error with the stats_public_test
<p>When I turn in my files to autograder, it gives me an error for the stats_public_test "error: attempt to subscript container with out-of-bounds index 3, but container only holds 3 elements". It's saying this in reference to my count function where I am returning "count3" which it says is wrong. I don't understand why that's wrong because the vector for the public test is {1,2,3} so the count function should return 3. </p>

-------------------------------------------------
We know that vectors are 0 indexed containers meaning that the first index starts at 0 not 1. Although a size of a vector is 3 indicating that there are 3 elements. The largest index in that vector is actually 2. 
<div>For example for the vector you have listed, the size would be 3 and the respective indices in the vector would be 0, 1, and 2. </div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>This fault is saying you're trying to access a 4th element at index 3. </div>

-------------------------------------------------
<p>Does autograder give any indication of where that issue occurs? Because I can output the correct public test and main tests to my terminal but autograder says it's wrong. </p>

-------------------------------------------------
Its likely because you're not writing a test that catches the out of bound indexing. Write some more test cases using extreme numbers. Additionally, you're going to want to look at every time you use v[something] and identify whether that something value could ever be as big as the size of the vector with how your code is set up. Also if you want to see what functions to look inside, check your autograder output and see where your code faults. It will likely be in the function that your code stops printing at.

-------------------------------------------------
There is likely a missing or extra curly brace } somewhere in your stats.cpp. 
<div>There are a lot of extensions you can install on VScode marketplace that can help with color coding brackets so its easy to match them. The most common being Bracket Pair Colorizer. </div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>Also, did you declare a main function in your stats.cpp? </div>

<p></p>


<p>When I made changes to the stats_tests.cpp file, this happened and I don't know how to recover the source code. Any ideas?</p>

-------------------------------------------------
Huh, so you overwrote your cpp file with your compiled code. 1. In the future, please use the make commands (they are pre written so that you can save time and avoid this mistake), so this doesn’t happen again, or learn to write your own (it’s not so bad, just read the make file and it should make sense). 2. In the bottom left corner, click the timeline bar, this is the only chance I think you have of recovery. It will show you versions like google docs would.

-------------------------------------------------
<p>Which "make" command would I run if I wanted to run stats_tests.exe?</p>

-------------------------------------------------
<p>So I would paste this in the terminal to run stats_tests.exe?</p>


<div>
<div>$(CXX) $(CXXFLAGS) stats_tests.cpp stats.cpp p1_library.cpp -o stats_tests.exe</div>
</div>

-------------------------------------------------
So to run an executable, something that we have compiled, you type “./stats_test.exe”. You don’t need to copy and paste anything from the makefile. To use the makefile type the word make and a keyword. The 280 setup tutorial gives more information on how to use it.

-------------------------------------------------
<p>Oh okay, I was doing that before, but I was able to recover my file using the timeline bar. Thanks!</p>

main public test (UB Checks)
<p>The only issue I am having right now is with main public test (UB Checks), no code is printing for the 100th percentile even though it is printing on main public tests and when I run my code on VS Code. Is there a quick fix to this or a way to test for this issue since my code works everywhere else so there is no way to tell that there is an issue in the first place. Thank you! </p>

<p></p>

-------------------------------------------------
The error for your output is showing that your are indexing out of bounds, specifically, trying to access the 5th element of a vector of only size 5. 
<div><br/></div>
<div>Try taking a look in your percentile function at any point that you use v[some_value] and ensure that in all cases (particularly the most extreme like 100th percentile) that the some_value is strictly less than the size of your vector </div>

SIGABRT Error

<p>I'm trying to run tests on stats.cpp using stats_tests.cpp, but keep getting a red error banner that pops up saying "Exception has occurred. SIGABRT":</p>

<p></p>


<p>I'm not sure what this could mean. Interestingly, I tried putting the summarize function at the end of stats.cpp so that I could verify the other functions would run, but I still got the same error at the same line number, despite that the code at that line number was different. </p>

-------------------------------------------------
Did you make clean and make test again after changing your code? If it's pausing on the same line even after changing the code it may be running a past executable

Try copying it over to there and run in Visual Studio again. (I’m assuming you mean you’re using Visual Studio and not VSCode)</p></div>

"expression preceding parentheses of apparent call must have (pointer-to-) function type" Error
<p>Hi, I wanted to call the mean() function while coding for stdev function and got the above error. Is there a rule forbidding the use of functions defined in the same file, or is there something else preventing my code?<img alt="Screen_Shot_2022-09-10_at_3.14.18_PM.pngNaN" src="/redirect/s3?bucket=uploads&amp;prefix=paste%2Fl7jpugxsxjq158%2F4c3b1c81f1bf06c3255f3a2e93be8a8dfcafcf3a502c0614bd5d433ee63e2358%2FScreen_Shot_2022-09-10_at_3.14.18_PM.png"/></p>

Try changing the name of your double from mean to something else. Seems like it may be confusing the double mean with the function mean

pthread_kill
<p>Everytime I run my debugger a pthread_kill tab pops up. Is this normal or something I should be worried about? <img alt="" height="914" src="/redirect/s3?bucket=uploads&amp;prefix=paste%2Fkk8laf9dvza6pf%2F20fd33bd5d4d6f597cce14cd2bfb96bc979b6b29367e76a6ac73240dae0174de%2FScreen_Shot_2022-09-10_at_3.13.48_PM.png" width="2292"/></p>

-------------------------------------------------
<p>The debugger is stepping into behind-the-scenes C++ code which is not always a problem. But I believe that pthread_kill is called to stop your program after an unhandled exception/error is found, so there's likely a bug somewhere in the code. Use the debugger to go line by line and see where the problematic line is.</p>

Printing output
<p>I finished writing all of my functions and calling them in main, however, I'm stuck on something that I feel like should be so simple. I'm trying to figure out how to place the colon in between the output, and when I try putting in the loop I get something like 6 1:, 7 1:, and so on. I feel like I'm forgetting something so simple but I just can't figure out what it is. <img alt="image.png" src="/redirect/s3?bucket=uploads&amp;prefix=paste%2Fkejgw934y4m2le%2F2bd05ac67ab3058bb85dea38f6edf2b4bb280b7e20bfc6b6c71cf4b231240bff%2Fimage.png"/></p>

This can get tricky if you use a nested for loop. Since you know the size of the inner vector (num, freq), think about how you can eliminate the inner loop. This should make it easier to add the :

Problems with stats.h file
<p>Hi, so the declaration of my functions in my stats.h file seems to be interrupting my stats.cpp file when I try to compile my test functions. How would I go about declaring a function properly so that this doesn't happen?</p>

-------------------------------------------------
The stats.h file should have the headers already (they are declared and need not be changed). Also what do you mean interrupting?

Cout in stats.cpp
I tried to print out something by writing cout at the end of the function, but I don’t know how to run and compile the stats.cpp it self. I included <iostream> to use cout and in the terminal I typed make stats.exe then typed ./stats.exe to run the file. But it’s shows “no such file or directory”. What should I do to print out somethings from stats.cpp, not from stats_test.cpp?

-------------------------------------------------
You actually cannot run stats.cpp on its own. The file simply holds a collection of functions so that they can be utilized in files like main or stats tests. 
<div>You can put cout statements in your functions for testing purposes but in order to see output from specific functions, you would set up a test and call the function in your stats tests file and run stats tests. That will allow you to run the function and see what it outputs. Alternatively, instead of cout statements in your functions, the debugger is a great tool to see what values in your function look like while it is executing</div>

I need help installing Homebrew on M1 Mac
<p>In the setup tutorial, it says to copy and paste "echo 'eval $(/opt/homebrew/bin/brew shellenv)' &gt;&gt; ~/.zprofile" into my terminal. I did this. Then the tutorial tells me to close and reopen the terminal. I did that and entered "which brew", but my terminal responds with "no brew found." Did anyone else run into this problem? How do I install Homebrew on M1 Macs? </p>

<p>You can try the steps on the official Homebrew website: <a href="https://brew.sh/" rel="noreferrer" target="_blank">https://brew.sh/</a></p>

Question about setup tutorial
<p>I am using VSCode on a Mac. On the setup tutorial, when it tells us to install a compiler, should I still enter "xcode-select --install", even though I'm planning on using VSCode? If not, then what should I enter into my terminal instead? </p>

<p>Yes, you'll want to run that to install the C++ compiler for your projects.</p>

Testing
<p>Should we just write out all the functions and test all them together, or should we make and test the functions separately one after another?</p>

-------------------------------------------------
<div class="markdown" id="q38kRj58oo0ooY"><p>You are expected to write at least one test function for each function in <code>stats.cpp</code>.</p>

<p>I guess I meant do you recommend testing the functions as we make them or after we make them all?</p>

<div class="markdown" id="q38kRj58oo1ooY"><p>Oh, my bad! I would suggest you test the function before you implement it and then do it one after another. In that way, you will know more about the function’s behavior before implementing it. Furthermore, there are also two pro-tips on the p1 spec:

error with "make test" command
<p>When I compile and run the three tests on their own (stats_test.exe, stats_public_test.exe, and main.exe), my code works fine. But when I try to use to "make test" command to compile and execute all three of the tests at once, I receive the following error. From doing some research, I understand this error may be a result of trying to access an invalid index in a vector but am still confused why the behavior is inconsistent.</p>

Undefined symbols compiler error

-------------------------------------------------
This error means you are trying to access out of bounds in a vector. In this case it's saying you have a vector of length 1 and are trying to index into the 1th place which does not exist (because containers are 0 indexed) 
<div><br/></div>
<div>To resolve this, look at every time you try to index in your percentile function. wherever you call v[some_value] ensure that some_value will always be less than the length of your vector. Pay attention to edge cases like very low and very high numbers </div>

Completed my project (maybe?) not sure where to go from here
<p>Hi,</p>


<p></p>


<p>So I think I've been "done" with the project for a couple days now (I've submitted multiple times and received 9/9 my past 3 submissions), but I don't feel like I should be completely done. I guess I'm looking for advice or tips on what I should do to improve my code even further after I feel like I've finished the project. I've gone through lecture and the specification thoroughly to add anything that I didn't think of on my own. I just don't want to get caught by the autograder tests when final submission time comes when I feel like I have a lot of time to edit my code. </p>


<p></p>


<p>A similar/related issue I am running into is feeling like I can't make any more edge tests for my code. I'm not sure if I've found all of them or if I need to think harder to create more obscure edge tests. If anyone has any advice relating to how to push myself to make my code the best it can be, please let me know!</p>


<p></p>


<p>Thank you!</p>

-------------------------------------------------
<p>Hi! Thanks for your question. Considering the autograder has private test cases you can't see until after the submission deadline, this is a common concern. Going back through lectures and the spec are excellent practices to help prevent losing points on these extra cases, so fabulous work! However, if you've been scoring so well on your submissions so far, I can confidently say that you'll be okay. Even if you do lose a few points, those are points to learn from! </p>


<p></p>


<p>As for coming up with edge cases for your code, I'd recommend taking a look at the range of input values in the descriptions of your function. Make sure you're testing the extremes of this range, and any other values that could potentially "break" your code. If you have a question about specific functions, let us know!</p>


<p></p>


<p>Also, make sure you take a solid break to take care of yourself. Self care is always more important than a grade in this class. Great work!</p>

Error in running main

 I don't understand why I am getting this error.

-------------------------------------------------
<p>The address sanitizer error tells us that you are likely trying to perform a read on memory that does not exist. One reason this may happen is indexing out of bounds in a vector. The next lines tell us it's hitting the error on the call of summarize on main.cpp line 27, specifically, on line 31 of stats.cpp in summarize. I would recommend taking a look at the lines that the error mentions.</p>


<p></p>


<p>A way you can figure out what is happening is setting a breakpoint in main.cpp before line 27 and stepping into the function causing the error before the error occurs to see what might be going on.</p>

doubles not being their actual value?
<p>Hi, </p>


<p></p>


<p>When I was writing test code in stats_tests.cpp, and going back and checking it after some of my assert values failed, I found plenty of cases like this, where when I push back or calculate a double, it's just comes up with a slightly different number instead;</p>


<p></p>


<p><img alt="image.png" src="/redirect/s3?bucket=uploads&amp;prefix=paste%2Fl7cazkcpyee7ny%2F603aacfef0340874d7b94464ad5e9929000cd5eb369359ced75c8cb2c4d9e2d1%2Fimage.png"/></p>


<p></p>


<p>I think it has something to do with negative decimals? It only does this for those, anyway.</p>


<p></p>


<p>It's messing up a lot of my assert functions; for example, even though a value is supposed to come out as exactly 0.5215 when done by hand, the assert fails because they calculated 0.521500000007 instead (though whenever I cout the value, it always rounds to 5 decimal places).</p>


<p><img alt="image.png" src="/redirect/s3?bucket=uploads&amp;prefix=paste%2Fl7cazkcpyee7ny%2Fc42836ae97d3221c6c61bd0bc3c8e5674c230679a47926a466726e640d32f690%2Fimage.png"/></p>


<p>(for reference, it's supposed to be calculating the median by adding 1.3 and -0.257, then dividing by 2 to get 0.5215)</p>


<p></p>


<p>What should I do? Should I do anything at all?</p>

-------------------------------------------------
Yes read specs for how to use an epsilon value to assert two values are close enough

-------------------------------------------------
<p>Yes, as the student said, please check out the "Floating Point Comparison" section of Appendix F of the project 1 spec. This will show you how to perform floating point comparisons. Let us know if you have any more questions!</p>

summarize function
<p>How can I add to a vector in-- {{num, frequency}, {num, frequency}} -- format. I tried push_back but it doesn't seem to work. </p>

-------------------------------------------------
You need a 2D vector. Push back to the first one, then push back to the second one.

-------------------------------------------------
your vector is a vector of vectors so you want to push back an entire vector. You can do this by creating a temp vector that you populate with your num and frequency and push that back into your final

<div class="markdown" id="q38kRj58oo0ooY"><p>I suggest you follow the tutorial to use the <code>make</code> command to compile your code. See <a href="https://eecs280staff.github.io/p1-stats/setup_make.html#compile-with-make" target="_blank">https://eecs280staff.github.io/p1-stats/setup_make.html#compile-with-make</a>, because it is preconfigured and you don’t need to type the long command.</p>
<p>The reason your assert function fails is because <code>count(v) == 3 </code> is false, which means that <code>count(v)</code> returns a value that is not equal to 3. That’s how you catch bugs by writing test functions. To go from here, check your <code>count()</code> function more carefully. I took a look at your code on Autograder, and the <code>count()</code> function always returns zero (so are the other functions in <code>stats.cpp</code>. You only <code>cout</code> the values, but you need to return them). I’m not sure if you have fixed that, but that’s the cause of the problem in the screenshot.</p></div>

UB Checks graded?
<p>Are we graded on UB checks? </p>


<p>I got a 9/9 on auntograder so I passed the public tests but am confused on the UB checks. There's no points associated with it on autograder, but I am getting a similar error for both main and stats_tests. What is happening in the UB checks</p>

-------------------------------------------------
<p>Though there are no points associated with it, the UB checks throw errors when there is undefined behavior possible. If you aren't passing the UB checks, that means your code reaches undefined behavior and that your code is viable to errors. The private tests are designed to find all edge cases and areas of undefined behavior. So even though there are no points associated with the UB checks, it may lead to lost points in the private tests.</p>

<p>Hmm, could you confirm for me that you have GDB installed? You can do this by running "gdb --version" in the VS Code terminal. If you get an error like "command not found," you can install GDB by running "sudo apt-get install gdb" (assuming you're using Ubuntu with WSL).</p>


<p></p>


<p>If you already have GDB installed, or if you install it and still get this error, try running "which gdb" in the terminal; this should give you the path to where GDB is installed. The output will probably be something like "usr/bin/gdb." Copy this value, and add a new entry to your launch.json like so:</p>


<p>"miDebuggerPath": "your/path/to/gdb"</p>


<p></p>


<p>One more thing: If you do all this and get an error about your program path being invalid (I'm not sure how well Windows and Linux paths mix in VS Code with WSL), try changing it to this:</p>


<p>"program": "${fileDirname}/stats_tests.exe"</p>


<p></p>


<p>Then, once you're ready to debug, open stats_tests.cpp, and start debugging from the Debug sidebar. This way, VS Code should automatically infer the program path. Hope this helps!</p>

Error on Autograder after submitting stats_tests.cpp after I implemented the test
<p>When I first submitted my code to the autograder (back when my stats_tests.cpp file was empty), I received a 9/9. Then I wrote all my tests today and ran them in VSCode and they all passed.

CAEN not using current files?
<p>It seems like when I run a test on CAEN that it is using files from before I started the project. I have fully implemented and tested main.cpp on my computer but when I run main on CAEN it outputs "Hello from main" like how we were supposed to have it before we implemented main. Is there any way that CAEN is not using the current version of my project and how do I fix it?</p>

What's allowed?
<p>I was wondering, for my functions do they all have to, be using vectors, or can some be using arrays? I have two functions left to write for project 1 and I am having a hard time implementing vectors within them.</p>

-------------------------------------------------
You can’t change the function stub, so if a vector is being passed into the function, you need to work with that vector. Could you share what functions you are working on? Imo vectors should be easier to deal with than arrays.

-------------------------------------------------
I agree, that’s an unclear explanation. Sizeof returns the amount of memory an object is consuming. 
<div><br/></div>
<div>So an int is 4 bytes. If you have an array with 8 ints, the array should be 32 bytes big. In this example, sizeof(array) is 32. </div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>Keep in mind an array is actually represented as a pointer to its first element. So doing *array, grabs array[0]. </div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>Therefore sizeof(array) / sizeof(*array) = 32/4 = 8 in this example.</div>

How to write to file in iostream?
<p>I was planning on using fstream to write to file, but I noticed it is not in the approved library list. I read in the file using the extract column function but I can not figure out how to use iostream.</p>

-------------------------------------------------
<p>I think there is no need for you to write something to file. Maybe you are trying to write the output? If so, use ./main.exe &lt; main_test.in &gt; main_test.out instead.</p>

-------------------------------------------------
<p>Use the cout to write to a file and cin to read from a file</p>

-------------------------------------------------
You assigned maxval as zero for each loop, which somehow isn’t even the problem you have here. I would evaluate what that would do, for starters.
<div>It might be a problem with your for loop, I think I know why you declared i as size_t, but that is not necessary and likely the source of your problem. To avoid this, I would suggest sorting the vector and then indexing the end.</div>
<div>To be sure, go ahead and cout the result of your max function call (cout &lt;&lt; max(data)).</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>Nvm it’s definitely what the instructor said, sorry I missed that.</div>

-------------------------------------------------
<p>It looks like you did not initialize i = 0 in your for loop. Unfortunately, computers don't default values to 0 (and instead something random). Remember that any value you initalize in a for loop is deleted at the end of the loop and then reinitialized at the starting value when the next iterations of the loop comes, so think about if you want to declare maxval instead or outside the for loop. Also remember that each variable you create must have a declaration type (like int, string, double). </p>

stats_tests void functions do not cout anything
<p>When I compile and run stats_tests.exe, the void functions do not output anything from the cout lines i put inside them. When i put a cout line in stats_tests main, it outputs to the terminal, but any of the void functions i call do nothing. What could i be doing wrong?</p>

-------------------------------------------------
Well, I guess I’m wondering if you are really calling them? I’ll give you the benefit of the doubt here. I would start small, try just making a little function like this:
<div><br/></div>
<div>void test() {</div>
<div>cout &lt;&lt; “banana bread” &lt;&lt; endl;</div>
<div>}</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>And then calling it in the main function:</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>int main() {</div>
<div>test();</div>
<div>}</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>If it doesn’t work, I would try to send a screenshot that doesn’t include code (like, including the headers is fine, for instance).</div>

-------------------------------------------------
<p>It was set up exactly like that, besides one thing. When I called it in the main function, I wrote void in front of the function call. I removed that and now it works. Thank you!</p>

summarize output not right

<p>Hi, I was wondering if I could get some pointers about what is wrong with my summarize function, and the output is at the bottom of the screenshot in the terminal. I tried to comment on what I intended each line of code to perform. the second screenshot is of main.cpp where the values are printed out</p>


<p> </p>


<p><img alt="image.pngNaN" src="/redirect/s3?bucket=uploads&amp;prefix=paste%2Fkt65g0odxxb5f6%2F5ac03a7943ffc0372eda4f5bce8707d653d2b960ad55d8acbca0e2dc3e5b837d%2Fimage.png"/></p>

-------------------------------------------------
Can you share how you are printing the output?

-------------------------------------------------
<p> i added my main.cpp screenshot</p>

-------------------------------------------------
Take a closer look at your inner loop in your printing

-------------------------------------------------
<p>is it not supposed to be j&lt;1</p>

-------------------------------------------------
<p>i see the problem is data[j] but i don't know how to access the frequency column</p>

-------------------------------------------------
<p>Here's a hint for indexing into the frequency column:</p>


<p>Let's say you have a vector of type int called x. Indexing into x will return an integer. For example, x[i] returns the integer at index i.</p>


<p>Now in your case, summary(data) returns a vector of vector of doubles. Let's call this vector summarized_data. If you index into summarized_data, i.e. summarized_data[i], you'll get a vector of doubles. This vector of doubles should be a (value: frequency) pair. How can you index these two values and print them out?</p>


<p>Here's another hint: You can do this with just one for-loop, rather than two. Hope this helps!</p>

-------------------------------------------------
<p>thank you i tried to assign summarize(data) into a new vector of vectors so I could index into it but I got errors that I think said the types were incompatible. and I also cant use two brackets like this [i][0].</p>

-------------------------------------------------
<p>I would double-check the type of the new vector you created against the return type of the summarize() function. For example, here's the method signature of summarize() from stats.h:</p>


<p>std::vector&lt;std::vector&lt;double&gt; &gt; summarize(std::vector&lt;double&gt; v);</p>


<p>So the new vector's type should be vector&lt;vector&lt;double&gt; &gt;. Once you've done that, the two-bracket syntax (i.e. [i][0]) should work.</p>

-------------------------------------------------
<p>yes thank you earlier for some reason it wasn't working but now it does</p>

-------------------------------------------------
<p>It looks like you successfully did log into caen because the terminal says shreygum@caen-vnc... . It might be exiting out of caen because an assertion failed, which caused rippling effects.

Mode Function
<p>I'm looking at the hints for the mode functions under stats.h, and I'm confused as to why you would need to sort the vector to find the mode. could I create a code without sorting it, since its just calculating the most frequent number.</p>

-------------------------------------------------
It is more convenient to sort it first. It should be possible without it, but it would be quite a bit more work.

-------------------------------------------------
<p>Why does sorting it first make it more convenient since we're calculating the frequency? </p>

-------------------------------------------------
With sorting and then finding the mode, first you sort, then you can have the code iterate through the vector and keep track of the largest pack of numbers it has seen so far. You can overwrite variables every time this happens.
<div><br/></div>
<div>Without sort, you would have to keep track of every number the loop saw. Imagine that there was a vector a million entries long, each entry unique, except for one repeat. How would you remember that you’d even seen this one number twice?</div>

<p></p>


<p>Now, as for the error itself, it looks like you might be indexing a vector out of bounds. Check out line 16 of stats.cpp; if you're looping over a vector, make sure the upper bound of the loop isn't larger than the vector you're indexing into. Hope this helps!</p>

<p>cout &lt;&lt; count(x) &lt;&lt; endl;</p>


<p>Do I need to create a vector for x? What gets read into there? Any help is appreciated!</p>

-------------------------------------------------
<p>So you need to read in the data. You need to write a little bit of code to read in the data. You need to cout something asking the user for a file name. Then, cin a file name, saving it as a string (then also ask for a column name). Then use the extract column function (syntax here):</p>


<div>
<div>vector&lt;double&gt; column = extract_column(filename, columnname);</div>
</div>



<p>And then that column vector is your x vector.</p>

-------------------------------------------------

Problem in main.cpp
<p>I'm trying to write the program in main.cpp, but am having some trouble. It seems I am unable to call any functions from any of the other starter files, even though I have #include "stats.h" and #include "p1_library.h." I also can't seem to use cout or cin (normally they turn purple in XCode, but are staying white so I'm assuming something is not working. Is there something I'm missing that I forgot to do? Thanks!</p>

-------------------------------------------------
<div class="markdown" id="q38kRj58oo0ooY"><p>What functions are you referring to? For <code>cout</code> or  <code>cin</code>, you will need to include <code>&lt;iostream&gt;</code>.</p></div>

-------------------------------------------------
<p>I have &lt;iostream&gt; included, and then for other functions, I'm referring to anything we wrote in stats.cpp.</p>

-------------------------------------------------
<div class="markdown" id="q38kRj58oo1ooY"><p>Could you try to do something like <code>cout &lt;&lt; count({1,2}) </code> in your main.cpp to test if there will be any error?</p></div>

-------------------------------------------------
<p>It doesn't appear to be giving any error, it's just not doing anything.</p>

-------------------------------------------------
<div class="markdown" id="q38kRj58oo2ooY"><p>Maybe you need to re-select the compile source in XCode to compile the main.cpp file.

autograder having issue with find function
<p>Hello, this question is in regards to the summarize function.</p>


<p></p>


<p>I am using a function known as find in an if statement to check if the value from the original vector parameter is in the vector of values that I am creating as a way to record what numbers are in the vector. IE{1,1,2,2,2,4,4,4,4,3 } -&gt; {1,2,3,4}</p>


<p></p>


<p>Here is a link to documentation regarding how this function works: <a href="https://cplusplus.com/reference/algorithm/find/" target="_blank">https://cplusplus.com/reference/algorithm/find/</a></p>


<p></p>


<p>However, the autograder is complaining about this function, here are the errors in question: </p>


<p></p>


<p></p>


<p>stats.cpp: In function 'std::vector&lt;std::vector&lt;double&gt; &gt; summarize(std::vector&lt;double&gt;)':<br/>stats.cpp:39:50: error: no matching function for call to 'find(std::vector&lt;int&gt;::iterator, std::vector&lt;int&gt;::iterator, __gnu_cxx::__alloc_traits&lt;std::allocator&lt;double&gt; &gt;::value_type&amp;)'<br/> bool flag = find(value.begin(), value.end(), v[i]) == value.end() ;<br/>                                                  ^<br/>In file included from /usr/include/c++/5/bits/locale_facets.h:48:0,<br/>                 from /usr/include/c++/5/bits/basic_ios.h:37,<br/>                 from /usr/include/c++/5/ios:44,<br/>                 from /usr/include/c++/5/ostream:38,<br/>                 from /usr/include/c++/5/iostream:39,<br/>                 from stats.cpp:7:<br/>/usr/include/c++/5/bits/streambuf_iterator.h:369:5: note: candidate: template&lt;class _CharT2&gt; typename __gnu_cxx::__enable_if&lt;std::__is_char&lt;_CharT2&gt;::__value, std::istreambuf_iterator&lt;_CharT&gt; &gt;::__type std::find(std::istreambuf_iterator&lt;_CharT&gt;, std::istreambuf_iterator&lt;_CharT&gt;, const _CharT2&amp;)<br/>     find(istreambuf_iterator&lt;_CharT&gt; __first,<br/>     ^<br/>/usr/include/c++/5/bits/streambuf_iterator.h:369:5: note:   template argument deduction/substitution failed:<br/>stats.cpp:39:50: note:   '__gnu_cxx::__normal_iterator&lt;int*, std::vector&lt;int&gt; &gt;' is not derived from 'std::istreambuf_iterator&lt;_CharT&gt;'<br/> bool flag = find(value.begin(), value.end(), v[i]) == value.end() ;<br/>                                                  ^<br/>make: *** [stats-warning-check.s] Error 1</p>

<p>Could someone please explain what it is exactly saying?</p>

-------------------------------------------------
<div class="markdown" id="q38kRj58oo0ooY"><p>The message is saying that the <code>find</code> function isn’t found - did you put <code>#include &lt;algorithm&gt;</code> at the start of your file?

Error fixed BUT still confused why it sometimes error and sometimes not.

<p></p>


<p>I don't quite understand this error message because I couldn't find an "allocator" function in my files. Thank you for the help!</p>

-------------------------------------------------
<p>It appears that you're going out of bounds in your mode function. That is, you're trying to index into a vector in a spot that doesn't exist. You're accessing v[3] when it only goes up to v[2]. </p>

-------------------------------------------------
<p>I am not so sure about that. It appears that it is testing on stats_public_tests.exe, and when I compile it as following and run it</p>


<pre>g++ -Wall -Werror -pedantic -g --std=c++11 stats_public_test.cpp stats.cpp p1_library.cpp -o stats_public_test.exe
./stats_public_tests.exe</pre>
<p>I pass the tests. But not when I use 'make test'.</p>


<p></p>


<p>In addition, I tried again just now without editing any code, it passed the both the given tests and the tests I wrote myself. But then it is again outputing the same error (but on another test case): out of bound.</p>

-------------------------------------------------
<p>this is the result I have now, with the same codes as last night. So it seems to me that this error does not always jump out, even if I am testing on the same test case with the same codes. Yesterday it errored on stats_public_tests.exe but not today.</p>

-------------------------------------------------
<p>It seems to be the function "summarize" causing this, but still the error does not always come up. Here is my code for summarize</p>

-------------------------------------------------
<p>Oh I just realized that before line 24, I did not check if it was already the last element. I added a if statement to check that and it is then solved. Phew, but it still confuses me why sometimes it works and sometimes not.</p>

-------------------------------------------------
<p>Compilers are funny like that. Sometimes they will make assumptions based on the code and other times they will throw an error. If you ever want to know for sure, submit to the autograder or run your code on CAEN. These two will always catch these types of errors.</p>

main.cpp
<p>can someone explain what we're doing in main.cpp. There are no direct directions on what we should do. I tried to follow what's on the p1-stats specs but I am still very confused.</p>

-------------------------------------------------
You should design functions in stats.cpp which perform your statistics operations, and then your main.cpp should be a driver program which calls these functions and prints them out. Hope this helps!

-------------------------------------------------
<p>That does help, thank you!</p>


<p></p>


<p>but do we have directions on how to actually do this? If so, where can I find them?</p>

-------------------------------------------------
Make the output for main match the correct output. This correct output is in one of the starter files.

<p><a href="https://eecs280staff.github.io/p1-stats/#example" rel="noreferrer" target="_blank">This</a> example kind of serves as what we're looking for. If you do these things exactly, you'll be good.</p>

Naming the vector of vectors
<p>Hello,</p>


<p></p>


<p>Can I name my vector of vectors Gertrude, or will I get points taken off? Should I instead name the vector of vectors "summary"? On the contrary, that seems too similar to everyone else. </p>


<p></p>


<p>Best,</p>


<p>Classmate</p>


<p></p>

-------------------------------------------------
Lol whenever I am just playing around with a bit of code, I’ll name whatever I can “Shrek”, Gertrude is nice too. Though yes what instructor said is wise.

-------------------------------------------------
Gertrude sounds nice. I think non-descriptive names are fine for P1, but going into P2 and later projects/CS classes, you want to get into the habit of using descriptive names for your variables.

-------------------------------------------------

------------------------@413-------------------------
Vector not empty
<p>For the functions in stats.cpp, we just need to assert that the vector is not empty for corresponding functions right? Do we need a certain output if the vector does end up being empty? Or does the auto grader not input empty vectors even for the private test cases?</p>

-------------------------------------------------
We won’t give you bad input aka we only give you what the RME specifies, but it’s good practice to assert( ) anything the RME specifies.

Summary Testing
<p>I'm trying to test summarize and I'm using the summarize(data) == answer_key format, yet it is still not passing my test. I iterated through the values to check and I'm getting exactly what I'm expecting in the answer key. Am I going about testing summarize correctly? Is there another way to test summarize?</p>

-------------------------------------------------
<p>The compiler doesn't understand how to compare vectors so you can't directly compare the results of your summarize function to a correct vector using ==. You're on the right track though! Looping through the values to check is the best way to go about this, so you can just use individual assert statements to check each of the values in your vector of vectors.</p>

stdev slightly off
<p>Hi!</p>


<p></p>


<p>I'm using the real life datasets from the p1 spec, but my stdev function is returning values that are slightly different from the ones that are specified in the spec:</p>


<p></p>


<p>My values      Spec Values</p>


<p>0.426247        0.4263</p>


<p>0.431925        0.431979</p>


<p></p>


<p>Are these differences ignorable? Or should I address them somehow - the formula that I used is the same as <a data-pats="post_ref" href="79" onclick="return PE.gotoPost('79');">@79</a>. uniqname: runy</p>


<p></p>


<p>Thanks!</p>

-------------------------------------------------
<p>hi! try using the formula that is in the comments of @79's post. there are three different formulas listed in the wikipedia and the one we are supposed to use is the last one that is listed. you might have used the first or second formula?</p>

-------------------------------------------------
<p>yes, I did use the one from @79's followup, and that's the one that's giving me the slightly off answer</p>

<p>I took the liberty of determining the population standard deviation—which is incorrect, as we want the sample standard deviation—for both columns, and they are <kbd>0.426247</kbd> and <kbd>0.431925</kbd>. Therefore, your program actually uses the population standard deviation formula, not the sample standard deviation formula. The original students' answer is correct.</p>

percentile in stats_tests.cpp
<p>while writing the test case for the percentile function in stats_tests.cpp, one of the cases i used were percentile(data, 0.40) and when i do assert(percentile(data, 0.40) == 2.4), the code stops compiling and says its false. But when printing percentile(data, 0.40), it prints out 2.4. im confused as to what is going on and why the assertion is false when it gives the same output. </p>

-------------------------------------------------
<div class="markdown" id="q38kRj58oo0ooY"><p>It could be that the output of the <code>percentile</code> function is not actually 2.4 and a number infinitesimally close due to floating point errors. See <a href="https://eecs280staff.github.io/p1-stats/#floating-point-comparisons" rel="noreferrer" target="_blank">this appendix</a> and <a data-pats="post_ref" href="262" onclick="return PE.gotoPost('262');">@262</a> for more info, but to compensate for this, you would check if the output of the function and the output you are expecting are within <code>0.00001</code> of each other.</p></div>

percentile rounding
<p>I've read a lot of piazza posts relating to the percentile function but I'm still confused as to how we should be rounding the return value. I tried using ceil which worked for testing integers but for doubles I would need a different system.</p>

-------------------------------------------------
<div class="markdown" id="q38kRj58oo0ooY"><p>You should not be rounding the return value of the funciton - instead you should be comparing the return value of the function to the correct answer in your test cases with a margin of error, namely <code>0.00001</code>.</p></div>

Public Tests - Undefined Behavior Checks

<div>FYI, the proper syntax is just the following:</div>

campus caen computers
hi,
<br/>
question unrelated to eecs280 content specifically, but
<br/>
<br/>
I'm still a bit confused on how the campus caen computers (or even just the computers on campus in general) work.  Are we allowed to download and install applications on our own account? Like for example, I booted into Red Hat Linux at a computer at The Dude and tried installing VS Code, but I don't have sudo access. Can I install WSL on the Windows version, or is that also not allowed? Even if we are allowed to install stuff, is it persistent or does it get wiped after every reboot?
<br/>
<br/>
I'm just wondering if it's possible for me to do work at these computers since they would be more convenient for me than my laptop or my desktop environment. I see people hook their laptops up to the monitors with an HDMI cable, but I'm interested in using the computers natively.

-------------------------------------------------
<p>I would recommend asking CAEN these questions. Most of us aren't too familiar with the CAEN computers. <a href="https://caen.engin.umich.edu/contact/" rel="noreferrer" target="_blank">Here's a link</a> to their contact page. You can email them or go to the CAEN help desk in the Duderstadt.</p>

Recurring Setup Issue
<p>I did the setup step by step correctly about two weeks ago, and the next time I went to use my terminal nothing worked (get zsh command not found message for g++, bash, curl, etc.). I did the setup again, but this issue is consistently happening despite having done the setup three times now. Is there any fix for this?</p>

-------------------------------------------------
Which terminal are you using? I know there’s a lot of terminology (like what’s a terminal vs what’s a shell but it doesn’t really matter here), but are you using Ubuntu? Like if you went and used windows terminal, that’s not what you want, you want Ubuntu.

-------------------------------------------------
<p>wmill I am using mac's built in terminal. Also relevant, I am using vscode.</p>

-------------------------------------------------
Ah I see, on windows there is an extra hoop to jump through, my guess was that it was perhaps that. I’m going to assume you did the mac setup, and given that assumption, I don’t have any further guesses, sorry.
<p></p>
<div>I mean, there is one thing that’s weird, on Mac you don’t use g++ nor bash, I believe, so that’s weird that is complaining that it’s missing those.</div>

c_cpp_properties.json file random errors??
<p>Hi there.</p>


<p></p>


<p>So I actually finished p1 a few days ago and submitted to the autograder and that is all well and good. Today I opened up vscode and saw that there was an error in c_cpp_properties.json. I literally completed the entire project with no issue so I have no idea why this started messing up. The compilerPath configuration is causing the error, and the only things that I ever edited in the file were cStandard and cppStandard, as directed by the setup tutorial. No clue why this started causing an error, but also since I'm already done with the project, is it something to be concerned about/fix?</p>


<p></p>


<p>Here is the error message: Cannot find "C:\Users\emmcn\AppData\Local\Packages\CanonicalGroupLimited.UbuntuonWindows_79rhkp1fndgsc\LocalState\rootfs\usr/bin/gcc".</p>

-------------------------------------------------
<p>These tests seems to be testing if there are any cases that are failing inside your code due to out-of-bound indexing and other issues such as a negative number where there shouldn't be one. So these test cases failing also means that your code is not working with universal test cases, even though you are seeing that it passes your own tests and the tests provided by the instructors.</p>


<p></p>


<p>You have to write your code so that it generally works when any <strong>valid</strong> dataset is given as the input file!</p>

<p>You have "out-of-bounds" error. Very likely it happens to your percentile function (but it could be anywhere you try to fetch an element from a vector).

STD function

<p>Here is the formula for standard deviation as listed in the Wikipedia page in the RME for the standard deviation function.  The summation symbol represents the sum of all the values in your vector. You can use the sum function to get that value. </p>


<p></p>


<p></p>


<p>For the summarize function, think about how you could use the sort function to help you. If a vector is sorted, it might make it easier to count all the values that are the same because they're in a row! </p>

<p>When I run my code this error comes up as after the column name is entered. This error only happens when I run main.cpp not stats_tests or the public tests. Not sure what would cause this. Any help is appreciated. Thanks!</p>

-------------------------------------------------
<p>This means that one of your functions took in an invalid argument. Are you using .at() function to get the values in your vector? If so it may be because you're indexing out of bounds somewhere so the the argument in .at() is out of range. If you're not using .at(), I would try and run this with your debugger and see what line it throws a fault on </p>

standard deviation only works with odd datasets
<p>My test case for standard deviation works perfectly fine when my tested vector has an odd number of elements (meaning it also works in main for the public test cases). However I noticed that if my tested vector has an even number of elements, my test case fails.</p>


<p></p>


<p>{1,2,3,4,5} = pass</p>


<p>{1,2,3,4,5,6} = fail</p>


<p></p>


<p>(Also, I have implemented the epsilon value and I know this is not the issue. My two values are off by roughly 0.1 every time so it's not a rounding error).</p>


<p></p>


<p>Any thoughts on why this is happening and how to fix?</p>

-------------------------------------------------
Probably want to make sure you’re using sample standard deviation and not population standard deviation.

-------------------------------------------------
<div class="markdown" id="q38kRj58oo0ooY"><p>For standard deviation, make sure you’re accessing the vector elements correctly, especially when considering that the value is not necessarily evenly divisible so we need the modf function. Try running through the failing vector by hand and then once again with your debugger and seeing if the values are being calculated correctly.</p></div>

<p>A reference must be initialized when it is created, so you can't declare</p>


<pre>int &amp;y;</pre>
<p>without initializing it, i.e.</p>


<pre>int x = 100;
int &amp;y = x;</pre>
<p>However, you can declare an uninitialized reference when it's used as a function parameter (pass by reference), i.e.</p>


<pre>void foo(int &amp;x) { ... }</pre>

Arraying indexing
<p>What will do if the compiler meets arr[2] is that, it will convert it directly into *(arr+2)? So actually arr[2] is just an abstract thing and lives upon pointer arithmetic?</p>

-------------------------------------------------
<div class="markdown" id="q38kRj58oo0ooY"><p>Yes, brackets in c++ are what we call syntax sugarcoating. This is an important distinction to make when dealing with arrays in project two. Brackets always will always conduct pointer arithmetic and then dereference the pointer.</p></div>

Confused about "Write your statistics program in main.cpp"
<p>Hi,</p>


<p>I was confused about the description provided in the instructions, which says "Put all of your statistics functions in <code>stats.cpp</code> and all statistics function tests in <code>stats_tests.cpp</code>. Write your statistics program in <code>main.cpp</code>." What is a statistics program? Is my main.cpp in good shape? Thank you!</p>


<p>(I chose that this post as only available to instructors, so it should be fine to upload my code?)</p>


<p></p>

-------------------------------------------------
<p>Yes, what you did is correct! It just means to put your "driver" program in main.cpp (like user input, calling each of the stats functions, printing output — this is the main program that will be run) while stats.cpp contains the actual implementation for each of those functions (code for calculating sum of values in vector, mean, median, etc)</p>

Summarize function out of bounds
<p>Hi,</p>


<p></p>


<p>I know that my function indexing the vector out of bounds because i'm comparing the current term with the term before it to remove any duplicates. It seems like a simple fix but for some reason I'm having a hard time coming up with an alternative. Can I get some help with this? Thanks so much. <img alt="Screenshot_2022-09-12_at_18.09.19.pngNaN" src="/redirect/s3?bucket=uploads&amp;prefix=paste%2Fky1wuq2ofmh5tt%2Fcd9a669878dc59b0735b1d922cd9896f35aae1804612ea08dfed1789288e7aa1%2FScreenshot_2022-09-12_at_18.09.19.png"/></p>

-------------------------------------------------
<div class="markdown" id="q38kRj58oo0ooY"><p>Think about the first iteration of the for loop. i = 0, so the if statement compares number to v[-1] which is now allowed. Without looking too closely, this seems like the only thing causing the out of bounds error. Remember, you can always change the value of <code>int i</code></p></div>

Errors met while doing "make test"
<p>Hi,</p>


<p>I generated such errors while running the "make test", will that be a problem? I faced similar issues during set up(malloc: nano zone...) and was solved by an instructor, but it reappeared such errors again today.</p>


<p>Also, is there any errors apart from the "malloc" ? Thank you!</p>

-------------------------------------------------
<p>Looks like you encountered the same error as <a data-pats="post_ref" href="130" onclick="return PE.gotoPost('130');">@130</a>. In short, this error is just a kernel optimization failure, and shouldn't affect the correctness of your program. Fortunately, you can disable this message permanently by adding the MallocNanoZone environment variable to your shell profile.</p>


<p></p>


<p>Your Mac is probably using zsh, so you'll want to open "~/.zprofile" in a text editor, and add "export MallocNanoZone=0" to the end of the file. If your Mac is using bash, add this to "~/.bash_profile". You might need to restart your terminal for this to take effect, but if the variable is set correctly, you should never see this error again. Hope this helps!</p>

SummarizeFunction.
<p>Hi, I'm not sure how to store my cout functions into a vector that I will store into the vector of doubles. Do I even need to? Also I'm not sure what to return so that my function will run. Thanks!</p>

-------------------------------------------------
<p>Yes you want to create a vector of vector of doubles that you will also return. Think about what the output looks like. You want your vector to reflect that format.<br/>&lt;<br/>&lt;6, 1&gt;,<br/>&lt;7, 1&gt;,<br/>&lt;8, 1&gt;,<br/>&lt;9, 1&gt;,<br/>&lt;10, 1&gt;</p>

-------------------------------------------------
<p>Okay so I tried to incorporate this, but I keep getting a few errors. For one, it doesn't seem to be letting me do summary[i].push_back(sumvec) to push back the vectors into the matrix. </p>


<p>Also besides this, I keep getting this error for my percentile function.</p>

-------------------------------------------------
<p>1. What's the error you're getting when doing this? Pushing back a vector of doubles into the 2D vector should work</p>


<p>2. The error is telling you that you're indexing out of bounds. Try stepping through your main function to see when you're hitting the error and debugging from there</p>

-------------------------------------------------
<p>It just doesn't allow me to index at i when pushing back into summary. </p>

-------------------------------------------------
<p>Oh, sorry, I misread your question. The syntax is just summary.push_back(sumvec) like you have in your code - was this not working?</p>

Sort function compiler error

You are only passing test.cpp to the compiler (g++). “sort” is implemented in p1_library.cpp, so you need to pass that in the g++ command as well.

-------------------------------------------------
<p>Those red and white messages are compiler errors:</p>


<p>- For the first one, it looks like you aren't returning anything from summarize(). If you haven't finished implementing summarize() and would like to test your other stats functions first, you can comment it out in stats.cpp. Same thing in your percentile() function.</p>


<p>- For all the "i &lt; v.size()" errors in your for-loops, it's because you're comparing an integer variable to the vector's size type, which is usually some unsigned integer type (don't worry about the details of size_type for now). You can easily fix these errors by trying some of the suggested fixes in the <a href="https://eecs280staff.github.io/p1-stats/#signed-and-unsigned-integer-comparisons" rel="noreferrer" target="_blank">spec</a>.</p>


<p>- For the code "medEVEN = medEVEN--", if you just want to decrement medEVEN, then "medEVEN--;" should do the trick. The "--" operator is shorthand for "medEVEN = medEVEN - 1".</p>

<p>When the expected output is compared to the student output, it says I am missing the 100th percentile line. However, when I run the file, that line shows up every time. Why is it not working when I submit it and how do I fix this error?</p>

-------------------------------------------------
<p>Do you have the Address Sanitizer enabled on your local machine? It may not be enabled and your code is just continuing with the undefined behavior associated with indexing out of bounds. You should use the debugger and see what your code does step-by-step when the 100th percentile is calculated.</p>

-------------------------------------------------
<p>Ditto the student answer. These out-of-bounds errors are common when using a for-loop to iterate over a vector, so I would double-check your loops' terminating conditions. For example, make sure "i" is never greater than or equal to the vector's size, or you'll go off the end!</p>

print summary error
<p>I set vector&lt;double&gt; v and set it as the result from exact_column, and vector&lt;vector&lt;double&gt;&gt; v1 as summarize(v). I use for loop to print elements of v1, like cout&lt;&lt; v1[i] but it shows a complier error. Isn't each vector an element in v1? How should I print it?</p>

-------------------------------------------------
Each entry in v1 is also an element and will have to be iterated through. I would suggest the following:
<div>cout &lt;&lt; v1[i][0] &lt;&lt; v1[i][1];</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>With some added syntax for it to come out looking nice.</div>

<p>I am trying to access the fourth element of a vector of size 5 and I keep getting this error. If I write a for loop I am able to get all 5 elements, yet when I try and cout it directly after element 2 I keep getting this error. </p>

-------------------------------------------------
Did you initialize i to be 0 in your for loop? Also note that for percentile 100, you will need a special case, if you don’t prepare for it, it will likely throw this exact error.

-------------------------------------------------
<p>Yes, for the for loop it works and I am able to print every element of the vector. Yet if I try and print any element after 2 not using a for loop I get this error. </p>

-------------------------------------------------
Really really weird then. To be safe, maybe cout v.size()? To see what it is?

-------------------------------------------------
<p>I did cout size and it said 5. Do you want me to take a picture of those lines of code?</p>

Yeah, this feels really really weird, I can’t figure it out without a little more guidance. Just be careful to include minimal stuff, I don’t want you to get in trouble.

<p>Let me know if that makes sense or if you need to see anything else. Thanks!</p>

-------------------------------------------------
<p>This is really strange. I don't know why it would be doing that, I would try making a private post and asking an instructor. My only guess is that somehow the variable type for i, when iterating through, is not an integer (so it does it automatically in the for loop, but fails in our simple integer call). Maybe try cout&lt;&lt; i  in your for loop to test this. Otherwise, I think it's time for some more experienced advice.</p>

Test cases
<p>If I am passing all test cases on Autograder, even the undefined checks, could there still be a chance that I lose points on the private tests? Do I still need to write more test cases?</p>

-------------------------------------------------
Yes, there is a very good chance that there are bugs remaining, more test cases should be written :)

-------------------------------------------------
<p>To add onto the students' answer, you should be thinking of possible edge cases that you may not have tested previously. Even if the tests you have run / the autograder public tests have not exposed a bug in your code, it is possible that a more specific test case (and perhaps one of the private tests) will.</p>

Did you call count and use a string in the call - in other words did you write count(file), where file = “main_test_data.tsv”, because the error says you passed it a string.

As the student said it looks like you're passing in the filename instead of a vector. Remember to get your desired vector you can make use of the extract_column function in the p1 library

Unless the REQUIRES clause for a function says that certain values are not allowed, then you should assume that we will test them.

<div>The “reasonable values” referred to in the student answer means we won’t test really really large numbers, because computer hardware can only represent numbers so large. Anything besides that is fair game.</div>

Error on autograder
All of my functions passed the tests, compiles, and runs perfectly in the terminal but when I put the files in the autograder, none of them seems to pass. Any help?

-------------------------------------------------
Are you using the make file to compile your stuff? It possible that there are warnings that you aren’t getting that would be revealed if you used the make file (the make file will automatically include the warning tags used when compiling).

-------------------------------------------------
<p>Also, try running your project in CAEN, as this will run your project in the same environment as autograder. Check out the CAEN tutorial for more information on how to do so: <a href="https://eecs280staff.github.io/p1-stats/setup_caen.html#prerequisites" rel="noreferrer" target="_blank">https://eecs280staff.github.io/p1-stats/setup_caen.html#prerequisites</a> </p>

-------------------------------------------------
<p>I am having the same issue, compiling successfully on my machine as well as CAEN Linux via the unmodified makefile. Something to note is that on CAEN I always need to change the GCC version via the command `module load gcc/7.1.0` from the p1 faq post, otherwise it fails. I assume autograder just isn't using the right version of GCC? How can I resolve this?</p>

-------------------------------------------------
<p>I get a compiler error when I try to compile your code on CAEN using gcc-7.1.0. Can you verify that you are running the most recent version of code?</p>

-------------------------------------------------
<p>Autograder reports that all files build except for stats.cpp. I added a comment to it and ran the r-sync command again. Then on CAEN I 'cat' commanded and saw the new comment. It builds and runs for me. </p>

<p></p>

-------------------------------------------------
<p>I believe the `make: *** Error 1` is only present when I include the diff command from the final line of the make test command... but I don't think that should be relevant?</p>

-------------------------------------------------
<p>The current compiler error on the AG is due to you calling the function "count_and_remove" before it is defined. Can you confirm if this is also the case on the code that you are successfully compiling on CAEN? (On the AG submission, you are calling it on line 21, and implementing it on line 27).</p>

-------------------------------------------------
<p>It looks like count_and_remove() was forward declared in stats.h however the function body definition was after the function in which count_and_remove() was used. I believe that shouldn't have caused an issue, correct?<br/>I moved the count_and_remove() function definition to be above all other function definitions, and it compiles and runs successfully on my machine and CAEN for me.<br/>How can I get you that code for you to test? Do I need to use another autograder submission for the day?</p>

-------------------------------------------------
<p>You shouldn't be modifying stats.h. That's not one of the files you submit to the autograder, so if you add function definitions, it won't be visible when run on the autograder. Redownload the original stats.h (and any other file you aren't submitting to the autograder) and make sure that compiles on CAEN. If everything compiles there, you should be good on the autograder.</p>

-------------------------------------------------
<p>I can't tell exactly where it's happening based on your main function, but the idea is that in one of your functions you are going out of bounds in your vector. Specifically, you're trying to access v[5] when the size of the vector is 5. Look through your functions or use your debugger to figure out exactly where this is occuring.</p>

CAEN not outputting correctly
When I put my code through the autograder it gets full points and when I run it normally through the terminal it pasts all the tests I put for it. But when I put my code through the CAEN option the only thing that is outputted is the original code (so main.exe prints out “this is main” etc.) and I’m not sure how to test it otherwise. I followed the CAEN tutorial again and recopied the files over, but I’m not sure if I made a mistake there.
<div><br/></div>
<div>Should I be concerned about this/How do I make the CAEN output my updated code?</div>

-------------------------------------------------
<p>That sounds like you probably aren't running the correct version of your code (the only reason running main.exe would print "this is main" is if you have a statement explicitly printing that in your code). Try running "make clean" on CAEN, and then run "cat main.cpp", which will print out that file. Is it the version you are expecting? If so, re-run "make" and try running again. If it's not the right version of the file, then we would need to see the output when you sync files over to see what's going wrong.</p>

When trying to run my main program, I am getting this error, how would I fix a segmentation fault?

-------------------------------------------------
a segmentation fault means you are indexing out of bounds somewhere. You should start by stepping through with your debugger to see where your program faults. You can then examine that line for where you index out of bounds. 
<div><br/></div>
<div>It's likely the first function you call after reading in the column. Or it is within any code after where you called the extract columb function</div>

I resolved this, the issue was with creating the 2D vector in int main()

Autograder - Public UB Checks "blah"
<p>Simple question I suppose... what is "blah"?</p>

-------------------------------------------------
<p>The greyed out tests are private test cases so details won't be released. The way to pass these is to thoroughly test your code so you know it's working! Running your project on CAEN is also a good strategy.</p>

-------------------------------------------------
<p>The "blah" "test" has since disappeared from the autograder.  I feel like it wasn't intended to be a test?  It probably doesn't matter too much but at the same time I kind of want to know why it showed up.  </p>

-------------------------------------------------
<p>I don't think it was supposed to be there. Probably just a mistake from modifying the AG to include the undefined behavior checks.</p>

summarize function not iterating through the last element
<p>Hey, so I'm trying to write my summarize function and it doesn't add the last element into my vector&lt;double&gt; (which then is added to the vector of vectors).</p>


<p></p>


<p>startPos and EndPos helps determine the frequency of a number (both starts at 0, with endPos taking the value of j and startPos taking the value of j after the number and its frequency are added into the vector.</p>


<p><img alt="image.png" src="/redirect/s3?bucket=uploads&amp;prefix=paste%2Fl7dhivtufkl2or%2F283c1849ff2506f3e74f9f5b7c96cb1bd5409cdbcb4bd5346b80b329934a1f10%2Fimage.png"/></p>


<p></p>


<p>I've tried including an or operator in the if statement to check if endPos is equal to the size of vector v minus 1. It basically checks if endPos is the last index in vector v.</p>


<p></p>


<p>When I try to debug it, at the last iteration (v.size() is 14, j is 13, endPos is 13, startPos is 11, and currentNum is 10), the program did go through the if statement, but it returned false and exited the for loop. Wouldn't the if statement be true because endPos is equal to v.size() - 1?</p>


<p></p>


<p>Thank you.</p>

-------------------------------------------------
<p>Try tracing through this example input: v = [1, 2, 2, 2]. After your code inserts the value:frequency pair for "1" into pairsInAVector, endPos is 1, currentNum is 2, and j is 1. Now, there is no other element in the vector that isn't 2, so (currentNum != v[j]) will never be true. Will (endPos  == (v.size() - 1)) ever be true, since you don't update endPos anywhere outside the if statement? Perhaps you should update that condition to check something other than endPos. Hope this helps!</p>

-------------------------------------------------
<p>Reading the error message, it says UndefinedBehavior. This is usually caused by out of bounds accesses. It looks like it originates from the summarize function line 16 in your code (also taken from the error message). The summarize function call came from main line 21. I would suggest looking at the data you were running and think about how it could access out of bounds in the summarize function.</p>

Too many test cases
<p>Is it possible to have too many test cases? I have 22 right now and want to make sure I won't be counted off for having too many. Thanks!</p>

-------------------------------------------------
I think you just need at least 1 for every function in stats.cpp.

-------------------------------------------------
<p>There is no max amount of test cases for this project and you will not lose points for having too many, as your test files are not submitted to the autograder (this time around). </p>


<p></p>


<p>In fact, a comprehensive test suite is encouraged! Once you have tested all of the functions and thought of all the edge cases you can, feel free to cap your test suite.</p>

Way to avoid putting test vectors into each individual function?
<p>Is there a place to put all the test vectors in Project 1 that work with each test function rather than having to put the vectors in each individual test function? Main.cpp didn't work. When I call vectors from main.cpp, it says undeclared identifier.</p>

-------------------------------------------------
<p>You could write a helper function that returns a specific vector. E.g.:</p>


<p></p>


<pre><span class="hljs-function"><span class="hljs-built_in">vector</span>&lt;<span class="hljs-keyword">double</span>&gt; <span class="hljs-title">get_special_vector</span><span class="hljs-params">()</span> </span>{

<p></p>


<p>although if you are using long enough vectors that reusing them is a pain, it might be worth rethinking your test cases. Remember that the small scope hypothesis says we should be able to expose any meaningful bug with a small test case (for this project, I don't think you should ever need more than 5 elements). Also remember that you can concisely initialize a vector using curly braces, e.g.:</p>


<p></p>


<pre>vector&lt;int&gt; v = {1,2,3};</pre>

<p>it gave me an answer pretty close to what i expected</p>


<p>also when it comes to the standard deviation, how many decimals do we need to show in our summary function?</p>

<p>Also does it matter that instead of having the formula calculate when it is given the 0th percentile and 100th percentile, I just have an if else if else where it outputs the largest number of the sorted vector for 100th, smallest for 0th and calculates it for all of the others?</p>

-------------------------------------------------
<p>I would think the Autograder does require an <strong>exact </strong>match between your output and the expected one.</p>

-------------------------------------------------
<p>If we provide you sample output, it can be helpful to compare your own output against our sample file on some sort of <a href="https://www.diffchecker.com/" rel="noreferrer" target="_blank">diff checker</a> or using the handy <kbd>diff </kbd>command in your command line to easily see if there is any difference. </p>


<p></p>

-------------------------------------------------
<p>Turns out it was the amount of white space for the printed response. So note to other students the autograder is that specific down to the spacing of your output. </p>

-------------------------------------------------

------------------------@503-------------------------
epsilon rounding
<p>I'm unsure on how the autograder will check private tests- for functions like sum or stdev, where the output could be a decimal value, how should I go about implementing floating number comparisons? I understand how the logic works, and can implement it in my own test program, but how do i know what this epsilon value that autograder uses will be? </p>

-------------------------------------------------
<p>I believe the epsilon value cited <a href="https://eecs280staff.github.io/p1-stats/#floating-point-comparisons" rel="noreferrer" target="_blank">in the spec</a> should be adequate for the autograder. So epsilon = 0.00001 should be fine!</p>

-------------------------------------------------
<p>Thanks, how exactly does autograder test my cases? Does it directly compare the value from my function to it's expected value? Like, does it do the epsilon comparison by itself? Would the only place that I would need to implement it be on my own test cases? </p>

-------------------------------------------------
<p>For Project 1, I think the autograder is just checking to see your tests exist. However, if we were grading for test correctness, the autograder would run your tests against a correct solution. If any of your tests fail against this solution, then we know that test is malformed -- or that there is a bug in our solution, but we test it thoroughly to ensure this is unlikely. If we were to grade your tests for their effectiveness (which future EECS classes like 281 do), the autograder would run your tests against solutions with known bugs, and count the number of bugs exposed by your tests.</p>


<p></p>


<p>In short, you don't need to worry about epsilon changing between your machine and the autograder. Epsilon is there only to account for any imprecision in floating-point calculations. Without using epsilon in your test cases, a test may mistakenly fail due to some minuscule imprecision; by adding some room for error into your tests, you remove these false positives. The epsilon value we give you is large enough to remove false positives, but small enough to not introduce false negatives -- that is, if the error is larger than epsilon, then there's probably a logic error in the implementation. The autograder's correct solution should not make floating-point errors bigger than epsilon. Hope this helps!</p>

-------------------------------------------------

------------------------@504-------------------------
NOTE REGARDING AUTOGRADER
<p>The autograder is very specific about the main.cpp output being exactly like the expected output down to the whitespace. So if the autograder is marking you down for a certain test and it seems like the program output and the expected output match exactly, turn on show whitespace. It will show you the differences in the spacing of the outputs and you need both to match exactly! </p>

Random number with summarize
<p>As you can see in line 5, I keep getting this random number in my output when running summarize, and not getting the number 10. How do I solve this?</p>


<p><a href="/redirect/s3?bucket=uploads&amp;prefix=paste%2Fkswmvh3nmaebm%2F76056d2cba7d0f8a5998787206ecdbaac732894f30b9711af0cc3c73c700479f%2Fautogradererr.png" rel="noreferrer" target="_blank">autogradererr.png</a></p>

-------------------------------------------------
Are you initializing your loop properly? It looks like you are indexing something that is at some random place in memory.

-------------------------------------------------
<p>The student is correct, that junk value is likely the output of a variable that has not been initialized. Also be careful that you are not printing i in a loop (i is simply a value that increments) but rather the values within your actual result vector. It also looks like your output is giving you an out of range error. I would run your debugger and ensure that your summarize function returns the correct vector by looking in the side variables panel. If that is correct then you can step through how you are printing it and see why you are printing that junk value. </p>


<p>. </p>


<p></p>

-------------------------------------------------
<p>how would I go about initializing the i? Would I just create a separate variable, such as summ = summary.at(i) to solve this or something else entirely?</p>

-------------------------------------------------
What I meant was the following:
<div><br/></div>
<div>for(int i=0; etc…){}</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>Specifically, initializing i=0 is the key here. </div>

-------------------------------------------------
<p>ohh I see, I did have that initialized and I got the error regardless.</p>

-------------------------------------------------
That’s strange, you aren’t indexing like this, are you:
<div>v[i-1];</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>That would cause problems. I highly doubt you did this, but it’s worth checking. I would recommend stepping through with the debugger to see whats going on, otherwise you will lose lots of points. Go to the setup page to learn how, it’s really easy, should take 5 minutes to learn.</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>Also, I love your text output for main, but unfortunately you will lose points if it is not precisely what is shown in main_test.out.correct</div>

percentiles
<p>is the percentile section in main always going to print 0, 25, 50, 75, and 100 (like the example in the spec)?</p>

This is my understanding, yes. Our main function is the driver function which is meant to match the expected output. Our stats functions in stats.cpp are meant to be able to handle any data that we give them so long as it does not violate the requires clause.

the compiler does not know how to print mainsummarize[i] as this value is a vector not a double.
<div><br/></div>
<div>I assume you are trying to print the values of the summarize vector. Instead of this method, think of how you can do it with a single for loop. </div>

Output in autograde not matching same auto grade in terminal
<p>I have the correct output in my terminal output (which includes the 100th percentile). But for some reason, the output in auto grade doesn't show the 100th percentile and I'm not sure why this output is different. </p>


<p><a href="/redirect/s3?bucket=uploads&amp;prefix=paste%2Fkk288hy5mmq5o5%2F6988889dd0d4423cb9bf1db11a55554da2dd5d6aa9066074fe06821b52dec36c%2F004D49AF-3D32-4B23-A387-37F74834F7C0_4_5005_c.jpeg" rel="noreferrer" target="_blank">004D49AF-3D32-4B23-A387-37F74834F7C0_4_5005_c.jpeg</a></p>

-------------------------------------------------
Show white space. You are missing space in front of your outputs. My guess is that the first screenshot is from the correct output file - in other words, you didn’t make that one. Just add spaces manually to fix this problem :)
<div>Edit: also you are going to want a special case for the 100th percentile. Given my guess about the file you were viewing, I don’t think your main.cpp was producing something for 100th percentile.</div>

-------------------------------------------------
<p>I already included white space according to the autograder and have something for the 100th percentile in my main function though.</p>


<p><a href="/redirect/s3?bucket=uploads&amp;prefix=paste%2Fkk288hy5mmq5o5%2Fec7808e1a273071f5ac34363b78097a767165a352be3d5cdcd346c7fa64d1683%2F3171BBC7-9BB4-4624-BFE3-382C59A0B365_4_5005_c.jpeg" rel="noreferrer" target="_blank">3171BBC7-9BB4-4624-BFE3-382C59A0B365_4_5005_c.jpeg</a></p>

-------------------------------------------------
<p>Based on the autograder output, it looks like you're indexing out of bounds of your vector during your 100th percentile calculation. You're trying to access v[5] when the size is 5, not 6. Take a look at this case and see what might be causing it.</p>

-------------------------------------------------
First thing, your percentile function should be taking numbers between 0 and 1. Second thing, autograder is not seeing your white space, despite the fact that you have it in your main, which is weird. Are you uploading the right file? Third thing, I meant you need a special case in the percentile function.

Can we use cout for summarize as long as everything lines up?
<p>Using C-out instead of vectors.</p>

-------------------------------------------------
There is a chance that you might not passing private tests as your data structure would be different, or you won’t be having a data structure as you simply printing them out.

-------------------------------------------------
<p>You will need to use vectors in your summarize function implementation (in stats.cpp) as you have to return a vector of vectors and populate it with the summarizing data. In main.cpp, you will cout the data in this vector in the format of "&lt;value&gt; : &lt;frequency".</p>

-------------------------------------------------

------------------------@521-------------------------
functions from stats.cpp not printing in terminal in main.cpp
<p>I made a vector of doubles data = extract_column(file, column)</p>


<p>Then I called the functions like this</p>


<p>summarize(data);</p>


<p>count(data);</p>


<p>and so on</p>


<p>Nothing prints in the terminal from these functions, what am I doing wrong?</p>

-------------------------------------------------
Did you cout them?

-------------------------------------------------
<p>As the student suggests, ensure that you are using cout to print data out to the terminal.</p>


<p></p>


<p>Note that you will not be able to just run:  cout &lt;&lt; summarize(data); </p>


<p></p>


<p>You will need to loop through the vector of vectors that summarize returns and cout each value individually.</p>


<p></p>

-------------------------------------------------

------------------------@522-------------------------
cannot cout summary
<p>I can call the summarize function, but if I try to cout, I get a compile error</p>

-------------------------------------------------
That’s because you cannot cout what summarize makes. You need to iterate through the double vector produced by summarize, cout-ing as you go.

-------------------------------------------------
<p>What I am confused about right now just double checking everything before my last submit, I see that in stats_public_test.cpp it has just</p>


<p></p>


<p>summarize();</p>


<p></p>


<p>by itself, as if it were supposed to be a void function, I am really confused, I guess given the thead above the returning of a double vector is correct, but why is this the case? should summarize be returning the vector AND C-outing?</p>

-------------------------------------------------
<p>Our stats_public_tests doesn't actually test summarize, it just makes sure that it runs. All summarize should be doing is returning the double vector.</p>

Terminal Issues
<p>After inputting the real data into my terminal, it gave me a segmentation fault but moved the main.cpp contents into stats_tests.cpp to see the problem, but it worked just fine. How can I find out why the real data works on xcode but not the terminal?</p>

-------------------------------------------------
<p>If you are running into segmentation faults, this is often due to an attempt to index out of bounds of an array. I would recommend compiling and running your code on CAEN, as this will give you an idea of how it will run on the autograder.</p>

-------------------------------------------------
<p>Idk how helpful this is, but I got a segmentation fault too at one point and after googling I discovered it was because I was calling vector values that were outside the vector.</p>

<p>I am trying to test summarize but my function keeps giving me this error as soon as it starts the summarize function. Could someone tell me what is wrong<img alt="image.pngNaN" height="467" src="/redirect/s3?bucket=uploads&amp;prefix=paste%2Fkk45otymxgq74m%2F42b0c81d2b6a77087a812ffaafb94c3add2840268a35c3cadce95c692981947b%2Fimage.png" width="827"/></p>

-------------------------------------------------
<p>Based on this error and the screenshot you posted, you are indexing out of bounds of your vector. Specifically where you have v[i-1], if i = 0, you're indexing v[-1] which doesn't exist.</p>

-------------------------------------------------
<p>Also this is my summarize function but i think it might be a little off, could<img alt="image.pngNaN" height="444" src="/redirect/s3?bucket=uploads&amp;prefix=paste%2Fkk45otymxgq74m%2Fdc6971fc08a08f50227c589bd58cd6bef955918c01ec61c991c64833a0538b32%2Fimage.png" width="438"/> someone help me?</p>

-------------------------------------------------
<p>How would i go about fixing that problem i thought about an if statement but im not sure how to write it</p>

-------------------------------------------------
<p>Try starting with i=1 and see what happens. You might have to adjust some of the rest of the statements, but that will help with going out of bounds.</p>

-------------------------------------------------
<p>i tried this but it didnt work<img alt="image.pngNaN" height="371" src="/redirect/s3?bucket=uploads&amp;prefix=paste%2Fkk45otymxgq74m%2F7f5ef4491e88053af1679e606c90204f15db34fa0e3b86aea09811777295d034%2Fimage.png" width="368"/></p>

-------------------------------------------------
<p>Could you explain what you mean by it didn't work?</p>

-------------------------------------------------
<p>it game me the same error, that it was still indexing at -1</p>

-------------------------------------------------
<p>Did you make sure to save and recompile?</p>

-------------------------------------------------
<p>yes i did</p>

-------------------------------------------------
<p>Alright, I'm not sure what is happening because based on your code you should never be hitting v[-1]. This might be something someone in OH can take a look at.</p>


<p></p>


<p>In the meantime, try to identify why it's going out of bounds. Having special cases is okay and you can focus your if statements on if i==0 or if i==v.size() -1. These are the tricky edge cases.</p>

-------------------------------------------------
<p>i also just tried this and it game me the same error</p>

-------------------------------------------------
<p>I think you might be over complicating it now. Go back to your original function and try editing that. If you’re still stuck, please go to Office Hours.</p>

Can we make our own additional functions?
<p>Can we make our own functions? I want to make some extra functions that will help with making the required functions needed for this project is that allowed or are we only allowed to make the required functions?</p>

-------------------------------------------------
<p> You can write your own functions, just make sure to declare them as static!</p>

-------------------------------------------------
<p>Thats great to hear I think... apologies but may ask what that means? I googled what a static function is in C++ and it says the following "A static function is <b>a member function of a class that can be called even when an object of the class is not initialized</b>. A static function cannot access any variable of its class except for static variables. The 'this' pointer points to the object that invokes the function." I don't completely understand what that means, is this saying that the function will not make any changes to the the input or?  Also are the functions that are required also static functions?</p>


<p></p>


<p></p>


<p><a href="https://www.researchgate.net/post/What_is_the_role_of_static_function_and_this_pointer_in_C#:~:text=A%20static%20function%20is%20a,object%20that%20invokes%20the%20function." rel="noreferrer" target="_blank">source for the quote</a></p>


<p></p>

-------------------------------------------------
<p>All I mean by that is put the word static in front of the return type. For example:</p>


<p></p>


<p>static int helper(…) {…}<br/><br/></p>


<p>that’s all!</p>

summarize (issue with running the test!)
<p>What is the issue here  ? (This is in stats_tests_cpp). *data* is a vector&lt;double&gt;. Just trying to cout to see what the resulting output would be. <img alt="Screen_Shot_2022-09-13_at_7.56.13_PM.png" src="/redirect/s3?bucket=uploads&amp;prefix=paste%2Fkt2b9bbjewsbt%2Fefc5860f0249eac54b61684d0bcf4b9d2441e93fdd92e71bec582af98cbb35a2%2FScreen_Shot_2022-09-13_at_7.56.13_PM.png"/></p>

-------------------------------------------------
You can’t ask cout to output a 2D vector, you have to iterate through it. It doesn’t know what you want it to do so it’s sad.

-------------------------------------------------
summarize returns a vector of vectors. C++ does not know how to print that out. You have to write a for loop manually printing the values in the vector of vectors returned by summarize!

What does this mean? Median test function gives error
<p><img alt="image.png" src="/redirect/s3?bucket=uploads&amp;prefix=paste%2Fky3tze2m3v25q0%2Ffedff83f49517853e4e634896332dbac3a70d046e308433450b7300add5add0a%2Fimage.png"/></p>


<p>My median test has a vector with 5 elements, the error says that its out of bounds but i dont get why</p>

-------------------------------------------------
<p>So, to be clear, indexing the 5th position of a size 5 vector is out of bounds because it is zero indexed, so the valid indices for a size 5 vector are 0,1,2,3, and 4. In your median function, you are at some point indexing out of bounds. I experienced the same problem, essentially, the solution was to put the last iteration outside of the loop, though I don't think I can say more than that.</p>

I would like to change to int, however the spec does say that summarize is supposed to return a double. *edit: every time I run it, the last number changes from 1.3, to 3.7, to 7.9, etc... (without even touching the code in between).<img alt="Screen_Shot_2022-09-13_at_8.43.44_PM.png" src="/redirect/s3?bucket=uploads&amp;prefix=paste%2Fkt2b9bbjewsbt%2F0f5c4f3d38d0c8d5fecd5ee56d6e6b7d6045fae8a1a31919ed090229c829167b%2FScreen_Shot_2022-09-13_at_8.43.44_PM.png"/></p>


<p></p>

-------------------------------------------------
<p>The frequency of the last number in the IDE is actually 1.31 x 10 ^ -310, which is its best approximation of the number 0 as a double. This is similar to issue outlined in the spec with the IDE having limited <a href="https://eecs280staff.github.io/p1-stats/#floating-point-comparisons" rel="noreferrer" target="_blank">floating point precision</a>.</p>


<p></p>


<p>You can consider this number to be 0, and if you wanted to assert it equals 0 you will have to follow the spec section linked above with setting an epsilon threshold.</p>


<p></p>


<p>If you just want it to print out to a certain number of decimal places, you can use:    std::cout &lt;&lt; std::fixed &lt;&lt; std::setprecision(2) &lt;&lt; decimal;</p>

grading
<p>Is there anything else that will affect the grade of our project besides the auto grader score? like if I get a 9/9 on my auto grader is there anything that will bring that down?</p>

-------------------------------------------------
The private tests. Aside from that, style and test cases are *not* graded on this project.

-------------------------------------------------
<p>Make sure you have thoroughly tested your code, including any edge cases you can think of, to check that all the functions are working. The private tests are the ones that are greyed out on autograder</p>

-------------------------------------------------
<p>Where are the private tests tested at? like my main.cpp has nothing in it but i got an 8/9 on the auto grader, do i need to complete main to check the private tests?</p>

-------------------------------------------------
You don’t see them until after the deadline, so make sure you test all possible edge cases

-------------------------------------------------
You won’t need main for it, autograder will just test your stats.cpp functions.

Error opening VS Code
<p>I was working on debugging on project 1 and I must have created an infinite loop to cause my program to crash. I force closed VS Code and my terminal, however, when I attempted to reopen VS Code from ubuntu, it said it could not find that program (referring to VS Code). I also cannot open VS Code on its own from Windows, however, it seems as though VS Code is still on my computer, it is just lost or something. How can I troubleshoot this to have the ability to open VS Code again (and hopefully continue my project)? </p>

Print Stats
Does it matter which order we print the stats out in? I don’t know how picky autograder will be with that?

-------------------------------------------------
It must be precisely the order in the main_test.out.correct file

-------------------------------------------------
<p>Your main.cpp output should look exactly as it does in the spec (order matters). It doesn't matter what order your stats.cpp is written in as long as all the functions are there</p>

-------------------------------------------------
Like the order in which the starter file gave the code and the public test case file prints stdev second to last but the specs has it 4th

-------------------------------------------------
The only order that matters is the stuff for main.

function calling
<p>Would I be allowed to create a new vector under the mode function, the new factor would keep track of the occurrence of each data point.

Floating Point Precision with the Summary Function
<p>Suppose you have two numbers 2.2453242431 and 2.2453240980. These two numbers are identical up to the fifth decimal place (the fifth decimal place is the same and the sixth is not). They are basically the same number; however, technically, there is a very, very small difference between the two. When writing test cases for summarize, should we count these two numbers as the same number or two separate numbers? I ask this because if one does need to consider them the same number, then one would need to introduce the epsilon stuff into the summarize function and also make sure that the number is displayed only to the fifth decimal place in the summary. Any thoughts on this would be helpful. Thanks!</p>

-------------------------------------------------
You’re indexing out of bounds for these things. To fix these errors, look at the for loops that you wrote in stats.cpp. It seems like the errors are in summary and somewhere else - this second bug location is not clear to me. Anyways, take a look at your functions with for loops, and write some cases that will highlight the failures that are there.

I don’t really know what your code is like, but when you call extract_column, the result needs to be stored in a new vector: for example, you can create a new vector— vector<double> extract;
<div><br/></div>
<div>Then store the extract_column:</div>
<div>extract = extract_column(___,___);</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>Then you can summarize on the extracted column.</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>If that’s what you meant to ask about, hooray. </div>
<div>Otherwise, it would seem that you may have indexed out of bounds…</div>
<div><br/></div>

-------------------------------------------------
<p>It looks like you solved this problem, but to make your life a little easier you can combine two lines in your code instead of having the for loop that I'm seeing on the autograder.</p>


<p></p>


<p>You can do something like: vector&lt;double&gt;v = extract_column(___,___)</p>

<div class="markdown" id="q38kRj58oo0ooY"><p>Typically this error is a result of indexing out of bounds. From looking over your implementation, I would expect the error is coming from the statement v.at(j - 1). However, it is a little hard for me to know for sure without seeing what you initialize your variables to before the for loops. Regardless, based on your logic, I would consider how necessary it is to have two variables - <code>currnum</code> and <code>freqnum</code> - which both seem to be tracking the same thing (the value you are currently counting the frequency of). Hope this helps, and feel free to follow up!</p></div>

-------------------------------------------------
<p>Have you tried syncing to CAEN, and running through there? This may help you debug your program locally.</p>


<p>This kind of issue can often be attributed to undefined behavior, i.e, things like running off the end of vector. I would take a look at how your percentile function handles the 100th percentile and ensure there is no possibility for undefined behavior.</p>

-------------------------------------------------
<p>It works out when I type it in the terminal, though. Would this be an Autograder issue, then?</p>

-------------------------------------------------
<p>This is undefined behavior, so it may work on your local machine/terminal, but the autograder will be the most accurate. Similar to the previous instructor's answer, I would recommend checking your percentile function to see if you're ever indexing outside the bounds. Ex: If a vector has a size of 5, you can only index 0-4 - make sure you aren't ever indexing at 5.</p>

Question about Autograder
<p>This is my first time ever using the autograder and it said I received 9/9 for my submission. Does that mean I'm finished with the project? Is there anything else I need to add?</p>


<p></p>


<p>Thanks for any advice!</p>

-------------------------------------------------
<p>You have received full points on the public tests. The majority of points are private, meaning they will be evaluated after 8:00 this evening, after the project is due. To ensure that your code is robust, test it with your own test cases, to see where the bugs are. You can keep submitting even past your 3 graded submits, since you already have 9/9, the feedback provided by these 3 submissions are not valuable to you, so they might as well not be there at all (to be clear, I just mean that you should submit at long as you think you have worked out another bug). The autograder will use the best result that you ever submitted, regardless of if you submitted broken ones afterwards. It's possible that your code is great, and there are no issues. It is more likely that there are bugs, so keep working on unit tests until you are satisfied with your code's performance. </p>

How to recover Code
<p>For the setup Xcode tutorial, there was a "Restarting this tutorial" section. I attempted this to make sure that everything was set correctly after making significant progress on the project and the previously written code disappeared. It said that this will not delete my code, but I have no clue where to find it. Does anyone know how I can recover it?<img alt="Screen_Shot_2022-09-14_at_2.09.16_AM.pngNaN" height="353" src="/redirect/s3?bucket=uploads&amp;prefix=paste%2Fkszll5ju34f4r7%2F78dbd57c3d60b861183c712f7f63bdac67bdf6a78bdff8ae2a02597b1fd18a3a%2FScreen_Shot_2022-09-14_at_2.09.16_AM.png" width="560"/></p>

-------------------------------------------------
<p>I'm so sorry to hear you can't find your code! If you've been using git with your project, you can always reset your local changes to the last commit. If you haven't been using git, have you submitted to the autograder recently? You should be able to download your previous submissions of main.cpp, stats.cpp, and stats_tests.cpp from there. Hope this works!</p>

<p>That vague "make: Error 1" message at the end just means your "make test" command failed, because one of your tests failed.

<p>Recall that the summarize() function returns a vector of vector of doubles (or vector&lt;vector&lt;double&gt;&gt;). In your "test_sum_small_data_set()", you're comparing this vector to an integer (6, in this case), which is a type mismatch. Based on this test's name, do you mean to call sum() instead of summarize()? Hope this helps!</p>

-------------------------------------------------
<p>I think I'm confused on how to print summarize from main. Should I be using a for loop or do I just call the summarize function?</p>

-------------------------------------------------
<p>The UB checks check for undefined behavior, so it's likely your program has some undefined behavior happening. Looking at your autograder output, it looks like you might be going off the ends of a vector. Check how your program handles calculating the 100th percentile!</p>

Edge cases
<p>When talking about edge cases, does that mean like index 0 and index of the size of the vector? like when I'm testing edge cases, is that what it means? to make sure you don't go out of bounds?</p>

-------------------------------------------------
Those would count as edge cases, but it’s not that literal, it’s just times when a function is given something that is not normal, like if a vector only had one entry, or something like that.

-------------------------------------------------
<p>Is their any specific way were supposed to go about making sure those pass?</p>

-------------------------------------------------
<p>It's about thorough test cases. Test your code with whatever might possibly break it. (they will test for these when your project is graded) What kind of special cases, numbers, etc. could expose bugs in your code?</p>

<p>Then when testing, you can use assert and manually type in the answer and then see if it lines up with what your code produces. Idk if I answered what you're looking for haha.</p>

Buffer Overflow / Bounds - Question
<p>Hey instructors - </p>


<p>I'm gonna attach a screenshot of my summarize function. I've been struggling with it for a couple of days and have gotten it to the point where I believe it would be extremely efficient, if it wasn't for one thing.</p>


<p></p>


<p>I believe that right now it's skipping over the last element in the vector. I'm trying to solve this by changing "k &lt; v.size()" to "k &lt;= v.size()" but the second I do that, it causes a buffer overflow. Would anybody be able to explain to me why this happens and what I can do about it?</p>


<p></p>


<p>Thanks guys.</p>


<p></p>


<p><img alt="Screen_Shot_2022-09-14_at_12.13.22_PM.pngNaN" src="/redirect/s3?bucket=uploads&amp;prefix=paste%2Fkta6k05vbph5wy%2F7c3878579b84a5db57b320b01d9a83bb997cc5721b32ad656d2e3fdf2bb2cc5b%2FScreen_Shot_2022-09-14_at_12.13.22_PM.png"/></p>


<p></p>


<p></p>

-------------------------------------------------
<p>Recall that vectors (and arrays, for that matter) are indexed starting from 0 in C/C++. So if you have a vector v with five elements in it, v.size() returns 5, and you can access indices 0 through 4. In the last iteration of your for-loop, k is equal to v.size(), which is one position after the last index, hence the buffer overflow.</p>


<p>I see what you mean about your code skipping the last entry in the summary. Consider tracing this example: v = [1, 2, 3]. In the last iteration of your for-loop, you add the summary for 2, but you never get the chance to for 3. Maybe you need some logic outside the loop? Hope this helps!</p>

<p>It looks like you're passing in a variable of type vector&lt;vector&lt;double&gt;&gt; into sort(), but the sort() function in p1_library.h expects a variable of type vector&lt;double&gt;. Also, you may want to double-check your definition of summarize() against the one in stats.h: Recall that summarize() is also supposed to take a vector&lt;double&gt; as input, and return a vector&lt;vector&lt;double&gt;&gt;.

I am confused as to where I should be adjusting my indexing in my code to properly attain the 100th percentile. I tried doing v.size-2 instead of v.size-1 but I keep getting errors. :/</p>


<p></p>

-------------------------------------------------
<p>Let's think about what the 100th percentile is, in this case. If you take an exam, and your score is the 100th percentile, that means you scored the highest in the class, right? So now in the context of P1, what are you looking for when you print the 100th percentile in v?</p>

My functions aren't looping until the end
<p>Hello, my uniqname cristi. I'm not sure how to fix my percentile and mode functions so they iterate until the end of the vector.</p>

-------------------------------------------------
<p>In your mode function, it looks like you're making this comparison:</p>


<pre>if (v[i] &lt; v[i + 2]) ...</pre>
<p dir="ltr">Your limits of i in your for loop are from 1 to v.size(). When i = v.size() - 2, this comparison becomes:</p>


<pre>if (v[v.size() - 2] &lt; v[v.size()]) ...</pre>
<p>The index v.size() is out-of-bounds, so you get an error before the loop ends. You'll have to modify your code a bit to avoid this out-of-bounds indexing. </p>


<p></p>


<p></p>


<p>In your percentile function, I'm not sure what you mean when you say you're not iterating through the whole vector because I don't see any loops that iterate through the vector. Could you elaborate?</p>

-------------------------------------------------
In autograder, my percentile function didn't give the 100th percentile in main.cpp.

-------------------------------------------------
<p>You need to make a special case in your percentile function when p = 1, otherwise you will index out of bounds later. Think of what the 100th percentile always is, no matter what numbers are in the vector.</p>

AutoGrader
<p>We have 3 graded submissions a day.</p>


<p></p>


<p></p>


<p>But, does that mean we can submit more than 3 times a day(just don't get feedback)--and the AutoGrader would grade the one with the most points?(even if it was past the 3 submissions a day?)</p>

<p>You cannot submit to the autograder more than 3 times, I tried.</p>

What does this error mean and how can I fix it so that I can run/debug my code

<p></p>


<p></p>

-------------------------------------------------
<p>Check on if launch.json is setup to run the .exe file of the file you are trying to run. The project instructions for what the .json is supposed to have shows you how to set it up for running the stats_tests.exe. If you are trying to run main then change that to main.exe.</p>


<p></p>


<p>If that does not work then, click on debug anyway, if it takes you to another error that says that some filepath does not exist and there is a button to open launch.json then do the following:</p>


<p></p>


<p>1. click on that launch.json button so that you make sure it is trying to run the launch.json in the .vscode folder associated with the code. </p>


<p>2. if that is the case then straight up delete the whole folder </p>


<p>3. navigate to the .cpp file you are trying to debug/run and click on the arrow in the top right corner and click on debug</p>


<p>it may ask whether you are sure if you would like to do that or not due to launch.json not existing, just click ok </p>


<p>4. make sure that it says the .exe for the file you are trying to run and that should work</p>


<p></p>


<p>This maybe your issue if you have a mac with an M1 chip, I found that copying and pasting the .json setup that they want us to use from the instructions does not work. </p>


<p></p>


<p></p>

-------------------------------------------------
<p>It is more useful to check the error messages on your terminal. I saw "undefined reference" (I cannot see your line 35, 36, 37 in the screenshot though). Did you include your "stats.h" in "main.cpp"? If yes, since the error is about your percentile function, I suggest you check whether you pass in the correct parameters (like the data types must match).</p>

Trouble indexing out of bounds for summarize
<p>I'm think my summarize function is ready to go except I'm getting an error message that I believe is saying im indexing out of bounds.  My loop seems to stop at the right stop though so I don't know what could be causing this.<a href="/redirect/s3?bucket=uploads&amp;prefix=paste%2Fksw56m2js1i4es%2F8c6f3d06ddf43c7289bc5e5add6421c9c0f098a731b24cf27dbd857d9c75212c%2FScreen_Shot_2022-09-14_at_1.37.05_PM.png" rel="noreferrer" target="_blank">Screen_Shot_2022-09-14_at_1.37.05_PM.png</a></p>

-------------------------------------------------
<p>Say we have a vector with 5 elements: _ _ _ _ _</p>


<p></p>


<p>The size here is 5. Since vectors are 0-indexed, we never want to access the element at index 5, because this would be going out of bounds: <span style="text-decoration:underline">0</span>  <span style="text-decoration:underline">1 </span> <span style="text-decoration:underline">2 </span> <span style="text-decoration:underline">3 </span> <span style="text-decoration:underline">4</span></p>


<p><span style="text-decoration:underline"></span></p>


<p>In your summarize function, do you see anywhere you might be trying to access the element past the end of the vector? (i.e. an element that does not exist?)</p>

-------------------------------------------------
<p>Ok in my for loop I realized I needed to have v.size()-1 but its still giving the same error so now I'm really confused</p>


<p></p>

-------------------------------------------------
<p>Quick clarification: Your original terminating condition for the loop, i &lt; v.size(), should be fine. If v.size() is 5, then the loop will evaluate for i=0 through i =4; once i=5, the loop will terminate.</p>


<p>So the problem doesn't seem to be in the for-loop's terminating condition... I would double-check the places you index into v in the for-loop's body to see if you can find any situations where you could go out of bounds.</p>

9/9 on autograder but orange main public test
<p>Hi instructors - </p>


<p></p>


<p>I got a 9/9 on the autograder but the main public tests are orange. They give me the points, and my output is exactly the same as what is expected, but I would just like to see if anybody could tell me if there's a specific function that's triggering it to be orange. I'm kind of betting it's my percentile function.</p>


<p></p>


<p>Thanks!</p>


<p></p>


<p>uniqname is wjrob</p>

-------------------------------------------------
<p>Your output looks great, but your program is exiting with code 1. This is because your main function in main.cpp is returning 1. As a convention, programs return an exit code of 0 if they run without error, and return a non-zero exit code if they encounter an error. So even though your program is running just fine, it's tricking the autograder into thinking there's an error by returning 1.</p>


<p>This has an easy fix: If your program makes it all the way to the end without error, it should return 0. Hope this helps!</p>

Percentile question
<p>If I have a single element data set for example just 1, what should the 0th and 100th percentile values be? Will it be 1 or undefined? This is one of my edge cases.</p>

<p>It should be 1, for all percentile values.</p>

Didn't put UMID in my documents
<p>I used up all my submissions but I didn't realize I had to put my UMID in because I added the class late (or maybe I missed it in the specs? didn't see it). Is there any way to submit again/Is it a big deal?</p>

<p>You are completely fine. We don't require your UMID in your files, it's just a recommendation.</p>

Does Autograder test stats.cpp independently of main.cpp?
<p>I wrote my functions in stats.cpp with the expectation that the vector input would always be sorted since I put sort(v); in main. This means my functions wouldn't work without main.</p>

-------------------------------------------------
Your functions should be able to run independently from main, yes!

New summarize error
<p>I fixed the error with random numbers, but now I'm getting 6:5 and not getting 10.  I know the data is just grabbing the size of the vector and putting it at 6, but why is 6 listed twice? How should I fix it?</p>

-------------------------------------------------
<p>Ok. After taking a look, I have a few recommendations.</p>


<p></p>


<p>1. if(currnum == v.at(i)) &lt;- think about what you should be comparing currnum to, what loop should we be using for this?</p>


<p>2. freqnum = v.at(i -1) &lt;- should we be going backwards?</p>


<p>3. for (size_t j = 0;) &lt;- if we're moving through the vector, do we always want to start back at the beginning if we don't care about those numbers anymore?</p>

stats_tests.cpp having error compiling on autograder, compiles and runs perfectly fine in VSCode
<p>I believe this is the same error as the error encountered in <a data-pats="post_ref" href="380" onclick="return PE.gotoPost('380');">@380</a> and possibly <a data-pats="post_ref" href="436" onclick="return PE.gotoPost('436');">@436</a>, but I wanted to check to make sure so that I didn't waste a submit, and I had a couple questions about the error.</p>


<p></p>


<p>I'm assuming that my problem is that I need to #include&lt;cmath&gt; in stats_tests.cpp, but in <a data-pats="post_ref" href="436" onclick="return PE.gotoPost('436');">@436</a> the student answer recommends that the original poster #include&lt;limits&gt;. Do I need to do that too? If so, why?</p>

<p>Also why is VSCode fine with me running stats_tests.cpp on it without cmath included but the autograder isn't?</p>

-------------------------------------------------
<p>yes add #include &lt;cmath&gt; to stats_tests.cpp -- as for the autograder question, vscode might be overlooking the fact cmath wasn't included and automatically recognizing the function but autograder does not. one way to check this is by running the project on CAEN, as it uses the same environment as autograder</p>

last line of percentile function
<p>My 100th percentile line will not come up on the autograder, however it come up on the terminal when I run main _test_data.

<p>and this is what my main looks like</p>

-------------------------------------------------
<p>You're going out of bounds of your vector when calculating the 100th percentile. Walk through your code with p = 1 to see why this might be happening. You might need to add a special case to account for this issue.</p>

-------------------------------------------------
<p>This is actually kind of strange, what I would do is I would is:</p>


<p></p>


<p>1. Redownload the Makefile just incase you happened to accidentally make changes to it</p>


<p>2. I would refer to this: <a href="https://eecs280staff.github.io/p1-stats/setup_caen.html#make-sync-shortcut" rel="noreferrer" target="_blank">https://eecs280staff.github.io/p1-stats/setup_caen.html#make-sync-shortcut</a> . It's a shortcut you can add to your makefile so you can easily sync to caen by typing: <strong>make sync</strong> in your terminal. </p>

Not sure what's going on in my main and stats
<p>Okie guys something weird happens to me, my project passed the stats public tests in autograder but i don't know why in main the format of the out put is still wrong, i mean, in main.cpp i basically just call every function, if my stats.cpp is fine, why the format goes like this in main.cpp???? my mode is correct in stats public test but it's wrong in main.cpp???</p>


<p></p>


<p><img alt="" height="1591" src="/redirect/s3?bucket=uploads&amp;prefix=paste%2Fksxfxo1r1f877a%2F56e4abef76631e16a7ab5aeb4c358d1ec4fb8ca710bcab3cba129ab08e034303%2FScreen_Shot_2022-09-14_at_4.01.24_PM.png" width="2228"/></p>

-------------------------------------------------
<p>1. It seems like your main.cpp just doesn't print the information in the correct way. As you can see, line 5 should be "6: 1". And it looks like you aren't calling/printing the summary function correctly as you're missing the frequency for 10.<br/><br/></p>


<p>2. It's certainly possible that your functions pass your unit tests as well as the public_test if these tests just aren't targeting what your function's weakness/error is. It's possible to pass the public tests but fail the main output here. You might just have to look closer at your mode function.</p>


<p></p>


<p>For future formatting issues with autograder, it's helpful as well to click the show whitespace button so you can see exactly where spaces / newlines are missing.</p>

Redirect
<p>Is the redirect portion of the main function required or can we leave it as taking the user's input for data and column?</p>

-------------------------------------------------
<div class="markdown" id="q38kRj58oo0ooY"><p>The redirect portion is not required and is client side, so you won’t get points off for not setting it up. It may be helpful to do so though since the autograder will be feeding data in that way, but there shouldn’t be any big difference.</p></div>

About using summarize
<p>I am quite confused about what is my summarize function doing, in last day's autograder, it shows my summarize prints output in a wrong format, without ":" and the frequency, then I edited part of my code and try to get access to corresponding frequency of each value.</p>


<p></p>


<p>So i have a 2d vector pairs, a 1d vector element,</p>


<p></p>


<p>Element = {CurrentValue, Count};</p>


<p>            Pairs.push_back(Element);</p>


<p></p>


<p>when i do the cout, how can i get the format: CurrentValue: Count ??? I tried something like </p>


<p></p>


<p><b>for</b>(j = 0; j &lt; Pairs.size(); j++){</p>


<p>        cout &lt;&lt; Pairs[j][0] &lt;&lt; ":" &lt;&lt; " " &lt;&lt; Pairs[1][j] &lt;&lt; endl;</p>


<p>    }</p>


<p></p>


<p>but it doesn't work.</p>

-------------------------------------------------
<p>And also i think my mode somehow will add one more count to what it should be, say the correct output is 6, mine is 7...</p>

-------------------------------------------------
For your summarize function think about where you are when indexing through pairs. For example, there are j elements in pairs. And there are only ever 2 objects in element. You’re very close with your current code for printing summarize!
<p></p>
<p></p>

-------------------------------------------------
<p>I don't quite get the point though, do you mean if Pairs[j] gives me the element I want,  then i should cout &lt;&lt; element[0] &lt;&lt; element[1] ???</p>

-------------------------------------------------
Well if you have two objects in element[j] and you want to print them, then you have the choice between either accessing the 0th element in j or the 1st element in j. Does this make more sense?
<p></p>

-------------------------------------------------
<p>like cout &lt;&lt; pair[j][0] &lt;&lt; pair[j][1]??? because j is our row ???</p>

-------------------------------------------------
<p>I really don't know when we do push back, how would the vector look like, is it like j rows 2 columns or 2 rows j columns???</p>

-------------------------------------------------
<p>Or the element itself is a vector holding two objects?? so I can do element[j][0] and element[j][1]</p>


<p></p>

-------------------------------------------------
Try running what you typed out :)

-------------------------------------------------
<p>This is one way of visualizing a 2D vector:</p>


<p></p>


<p><code>{</code><br/><code>   {1, 2},</code></p>


<p><code>   {3, 4},</code></p>


<p><code>   {5, 6}</code></p>


<p><code>}</code></p>


<p></p>


<p>When you are using the first index, you are choosing one of the "inner" vectors within the outer one. So, if I have a 2D vector called x, then x[0] would yield the first inner vector:<br/><br/></p>


<p><code>{</code><br/><code>   <em><strong>{1, 2}</strong></em>,</code></p>


<p><code>   {3, 4},</code></p>


<p><code>   {5, 6}</code></p>


<p><code>}</code></p>


<p></p>


<p>The second index will choose an integer within my inner vector, just like normal. So x[0][1] would give me the 2nd integer within the inner vector, which in this case is 2:</p>


<p></p>


<p><code>{</code><br/><code>   {1, <strong><em>2</em></strong>},</code></p>


<p><code>   {3, 4},</code></p>


<p><code>   {5, 6}</code></p>


<p><code>}</code></p>


<p></p>


<p>In the case of summarize, the inner vectors always have a size of 2. So you can use one loop with a counter <code>j</code> and print out the elements using <code>element[j][0]</code> and <code>element[j][1]</code> like you mentioned previously.</p>

<p>The index out of bounds error is going to happen anywhere that you're indexing into v. That means it's either happening where you're initializing a, initializing b, or initializing perc. Your error message should be able to tell you which line here is causing the index problem. </p>

percentile - overindexing and starting from index 0
<p>Hi, what specifically in the percentile formula is causing it to index from 1? Is it the +1 in rank? I am trying to figure out how to avoid overindexing. thanks!</p>

-------------------------------------------------
<p>These posts should help you with this: <a data-pats="post_ref" href="523" onclick="return PE.gotoPost('523');">@523</a> <a data-pats="post_ref" href="519" onclick="return PE.gotoPost('519');">@519</a></p>


<p></p>


<p>The reason why you have to deal with overindexing is because the formula uses the value of <code>k+1</code> (consider whether there is an input that will yield a value <code>k</code> that lets you go out-of-bounds).</p>

<p></p>


<p></p>


<p>Edit: apparently the UB checks don't really matter (?) but it's for my sanity and knowledge. Could someone check my code?</p>

-------------------------------------------------
<p>Double check that the bounds on your loops are correct in the <code>summarize</code> function (specifically, I would take a look at your inner loop that counts repeating numbers). The output is telling you that you are indexing out of the bounds of the vector.</p>

About summarize
<p>My summarize function can't print the last pair of data( i mean the number and it's corresponding frequency), and for the first pair of data, the frequency will automatically adding 1 itself.....<img alt="" height="1096" src="/redirect/s3?bucket=uploads&amp;prefix=paste%2Fksxfxo1r1f877a%2Fc6c2f2e04463f4f083447ee60ee20214d9c2661d35e30df7c35ab374f2895acf%2FScreen_Shot_2022-09-14_at_7.18.11_PM.png" width="1484"/></p>

-------------------------------------------------
<div class="markdown" id="q38kRj58oo0ooY"><ul><li>My summarize function can’t print the last pair of data</li></ul>
<p>The last element is not being pushed to the vector.</p>
<ul><li>for the first pair of data, the frequency will automatically adding 1 itself</li></ul>
<p>You initialize count to 1 and begin the for loop at the first element. So you basically compare the first element with itself so <code>count</code> will always be incremented by 1 at the beginning.</p>
<p>I strongly recommend you use the debugger to go through your code.</p></div>

Project 2 FAQ
<p>Refer to this post for Frequently Asked Questions regarding Project 2. Project 2 is due <strong>Wednesday</strong><strong>, September 28th at 8pm</strong>.  Please keep the followups related to questions in this post only.</p>


<p></p>


<p>Spec is <a href="https://eecs280staff.github.io/p2-cv/" rel="noreferrer" target="_blank">here</a>. </p>


<p><br/>Resize GUI repository (you can use this to easily try your resize code on other images!): <a href="https://github.com/oalejel/resize-GUI" rel="noreferrer" target="_blank">https://github.com/oalejel/resize-GUI</a><a href="https://github.com/oalejel/resize-GUI" rel="noreferrer" target="_blank"></a></p>


<p><br/>Write clear code! This is especially important for this project, remember:<br/><strong>Matrix width = # of columns</strong><br/><strong>Matrix height = # of rows</strong><br/>Instead of using variables like "i" and "j" in your for-loops, consider using "row" and "col" so you don't get confused!<br/><br/><strong>Q: Am I required to use traversal by pointer?</strong><br/>A: <strong>No.</strong> You are allowed to, but not required to use traversal by pointer in this project. You should choose to traverse by index/pointer based on what makes sense to you logically.<br/><br/><strong>Q: My program takes a couple minutes or more to run. Is this expected? </strong><br/>A: Yes, but not too long - your program should run in under 30 seconds. Double check that you're not looping unnecessarily or calling an inefficient function within a loop. Perf is also a helpful tool for improving efficiency! <a href="https://eecs280staff.github.io/p2-cv/#appendix-b-perf-tutorial" rel="noreferrer" target="_blank">https://eecs280staff.github.io/p2-cv/#appendix-b-perf-tutorial</a><a href="https://eecs280staff.github.io/p2-cv/#appendix-b-perf-tutorial" rel="noreferrer" target="_blank"></a><br/><br/><strong>Q: Rotate left is failing, even though it was provided. Is there an error in the provided function?</strong> <br/>A: Rotate left calls several student implemented image functions, which can cause errors in rotate left.<br/><br/><strong>Q: Why do I have to write functions like Matrix_width? Couldn't I just use matrix-&gt;width directly?</strong><br/>A: Unless you're implementing a Matrix function, this is generally considered really poor design! We actually consider this incorrect behavior, even if you get the right results, so please make sure you use the right function. Even if it's just Matrix_width and Matrix_height, whenever you're not writing Matrix functions, go through the interface - the same goes for Image as well.<br/><br/><strong>Q: Do I have to respect the interface when writing tests?</strong><br/>A: Yes, tests should always respect the interface! In the real world, this means you can reuse tests when changing the implementation to make sure that you haven't also changed the interface, such that you can avoid updating the code everywhere the interface is used!<br/><br/><strong>Q: How can I test Matrix_at without breaking the interface?</strong><br/>A: When thinking of unit testing, you should think in units as behavior instead of units as functions, because it is common to have functions like Matrix_at that solely rely on the underlying implementation. When testing Matrix_at, we really want to test the behavior of setting and retrieving independent values reliably from our matrix. For example, you could test that setting a value at (0,1) doesn't modify the value at (1,0) or other similar variations of this.<br/><br/><strong>Q: What does it mean for the column start to be inclusive and the column end to be exclusive?</strong> <br/>A: This means that when looking for the min value, you should consider the column start but not column end. For example, if my column start was 2 and my column end was 5, I would consider columns 2,3, and 4, but not 5. <br/><br/><strong>Q: Why am I failing crabster but passing dog and horses?</strong><br/>A: Crabster tends to catch more edge cases. Be sure that in all cases you're checking the correct columns when you compute the energy, cost, and seam.</p>


<p><br/><strong>Q: One of my processing test is failing, but when I print out the output it matches the correct file.</strong> <br/>A: Double check your image init. If you read in the correct image incorrectly, then Image_equal will fail even if you've processed the image correctly.</p>


<p></p>


<p><strong>Q: I am missing some test cases. What other tests should I write to catch the test cases?</strong></p>


<p>A: Sorry! We don't share what test cases the AG is looking for. The best advice we can give it to brainstorm more edge cases. </p>


<p></p>


<p><strong>Q: I'm trying to run processing_public_test.cpp/resize.cpp on XCode, and Xcode is saying that it's unable to open dog.ppm/crabster.ppm/horses.ppm.</strong></p>


<p>A: You need to update XCode's custom working directory: <a href="https://eecs280staff.github.io/p1-stats/setup_xcode.html#run" rel="noreferrer" target="_blank">https://eecs280staff.github.io/p1-stats/setup_xcode.html#run</a></p>

Difficulty with downloading files off of GitHub
I am trying to download files off of GitHub (ie clone them) as my partner for project 2 already uploaded them. However, I am getting this error when it comes to the remote repository. I was hoping someone could help me fix that? It seemed to work ok on Tuesday at my lab so I'm not sure where I'm going wrong. Thank you!

version control
<p>The version control setup tutorial features p1-stats instead of p2-cv. Does it matter if we setup version control with p1-stats even though we are using it for p2-cv, or should we set it up in our p2-cv directory instead? Only problem I see with the second option is that we don't have any starter code for p2-cv yet when it asks us to go through the version control setup tutorial. </p>


<p></p>


<p>Thank you!</p>

-------------------------------------------------
<div class="markdown" id="q38kRj58oo0ooY"><p>The p2 spec shows you where to fetch starter files from. From there, you can basically repeat the same steps as in the p1-stats tutorial but with your p2 files instead.</p></div>

Switching from Xcode to VScode
<p>If I decide after finishing project 1 that I would now like to switch to using VS Code instead of X Code, is that a possibility? And if so, which parts of the set up tutorial should I do? I think it would be easier to use VSCode, however at the time of the original set up I was intimidated by the thought of using a new platform. </p>

-------------------------------------------------
<div class="markdown" id="q38kRj58oo0ooY"><p>You may go through this setup tutorial: <a href="https://eecs280staff.github.io/p1-stats/setup_vscode.html" target="_blank">https://eecs280staff.github.io/p1-stats/setup_vscode.html</a>.</p></div>

-------------------------------------------------
<p>even though it's for project 1?</p>

-------------------------------------------------
<p>The important steps of the setup tutorial can be applied to any project, just anywhere the tutorial uses p1 files swap them out for p2. In other words, where the "Prerequisites" show that you should have a folder of the p1 files, follow the p2 spec to download the p2 starter files and continue from there.</p>

project 1 - summarize tests
<p>Hi, on my end the summarize function worked but on the autograder it failed both tests -- can someone please clarify what was wrong thru autograder? uniqname is ekahrem</p>

-------------------------------------------------
<p>I believe you had some out-of-bounds errors, where you attempted to access an element within a vector at an invalid index. Always be careful and remember that indices are only valid in the range of 0 - (size - 1). If you would want some further clarification with this, feel free to come to office hours!</p>


<p></p>


<p>(Kevin) Adding to Tyler's answer: it's possible that in your local environment, you had old data leftover that you were "successfully" able to index into. The autograder basically cleans and resets memory so that everyone's tests are evaluated in the same conditions, which could be why it worked locally but not on autograder. For future reference, <a href="https://eecs280staff.github.io/p1-stats/setup_caen.html" rel="noreferrer" target="_blank">this is what CAEN is for</a> - CAEN has the same environment as the autograder and will help you catch issues like this.</p>

Project partner if i'm retaking the class?
<p>I'm currently retaking EECS 280. I was wondering if I was allowed to collaborate with a project partner for the upcoming projects if i'm retaking the class? I genuinely work better in a collaborative environments (and i did not do great on some of the projects the first time I did them), but I don't want to do anything that breaks honor code and I understand if this is not allowed. Thank you!</p>


<p></p>

-------------------------------------------------
<p>In the partner guideline, it mentions that you can choose to find a partner, but you should start the project from scratch instead of using your legacy codes.</p>

Array decay
<p style="text-align:left">In the array decay lecture, there is one slide page mentions that</p>


<p style="text-align:left"><img alt="image.png" src="/redirect/s3?bucket=uploads&amp;prefix=paste%2Fl7gbxa2boas4b6%2F240d8846ce4b8811e5634e8fb9f37b1fe0de63bf9c9f2aa949094d62c0f16270%2Fimage.png"/></p>


<p style="text-align:left">What does it mean by "Doesn't happen if you use * or []" and "Doesn't apply if array appears to the left of ="? What specific situations are these two sentences referring to?</p>


<p style="text-align:left">Moreover, I am really confused about array decay. Why is it even exists? It seems that there is no such thing in other languages like Java or Python. And in what situations will array decay occurs?</p>


<p style="text-align:left">Thanks so much!</p>

-------------------------------------------------
<p>In regards to those "Doesn't" bullets, they're referencing the fact that the array will not decay to a pointer that is pointing at the first element if the array is dereferenced using the * operator or if a specific element of the array is being accessed. The "=" one I believe is in reference to initializing an array.</p>


<p></p>


<p>C++ is a lower level language than Python or Java, and by using the array, we can access its elements using pointer arithmetic, which I'm guessing isn't possible in other languages.</p>


<p></p>


<p>As stated in the lecture, array decay will occur when the name of the array is used without any * or [] operator. For instance:</p>


<p></p>


<p>int arr[3] = {1, 2, 3};</p>


<p>cout &lt;&lt; arr;</p>


<p></p>


<p>would print the pointer of the first element of the array.</p>

-------------------------------------------------
<div class="markdown" id="q38kRj58oo0ooY"><p>Part 1, which is most of what you asked about:</p>
<p>Let’s say we have array <code>a</code> at location 0x0000:</p>
<pre><code>int a[5];
for (int i = 0; i &lt; 5; ++i)
{
    a[i]  = i;
}
</code></pre><p>The second bullet point is saying that we don’t decay to pointer if we index using <code>[]</code> (e.g. <code>a[2]</code> returns 2) or dereference with <code>*</code> (e.g. <code>*a</code> returns 0 - as a rule, dereferencing returns the first element). We do decay to pointer if we just read <code>a</code> by itself: <code>int* start = a</code> will set <code>start</code> to <code>0x0000</code>. Any time we read <code>a</code> without using either the <code>*</code> or <code>[]</code> operators, pointer decay will occur and <code>a</code> will be interpreted as a pointer.</p>
<hr/>
<p>Part 2, specifically “why?”</p>
<p>Why does this exist? Great question! I went down a bit of a rabbit hole answering this, but the question really boils down to why should you use pointers at all. As far as I know, part of it is computer science history and part of it is the contrast between C / C++ and some other languages. I would say that 90% of the time when you’re coding “in real life”, you don’t need to worry about pointers; however, in the other 10%, you <strong>really really</strong> need to know what you’re doing with pointers. Take what I say with a grain of salt because I am a student and don’t really know that much more either.</p>
<p>First, the history. Wikipedia says that pointers were first introduced as an idea in the Soviet Union in the 1950s and were independently discovered in the 1960s in the west. Computer science at this time was a lot more annoying - take a look at some FORTRAN or Lisp code if you want an idea - and one of the annoying things was that you had to deal with memory a lot more directly. For example, on the Wikipedia example of a FORTRAN II program, the first line of code reads from an actual physical tape roll of data. This was I think pretty typical - you had to manually read and write data from some input instead of the nicer way we have through the terminal today. The introduction of pointers meant that instead of reading / writing every time you want to manipulate something in memory, you can just keep a pointer to the same address and dereference whenever you want to read / write. I <em>think</em> this basically makes the pointer a nice little “wrapper” for everything you might want to do with a memory address, including reading / writing to that specific address. As computers and programming languages became more advanced, we’ve tried to do even more abstraction; this is why you don’t see explicit pointer types in Python and Java, for example.</p>
<p>The reason this is still important, and a big part of what keeps C / C++ in use despite its age, is that having easy access to lower-level stuff allows for a lot more optimization than a “nicer” language like Java or Python. For example, the Tiger engine used in the video games for the <em>Halo</em> franchise goes crazy with optimization, because there’s so much going on in a video game and not a lot of power on a console to work with (Halo Combat Evolved had to fit in I think 32 MB of RAM - for reference most computers nowadays have 256-512 times that much). Careful memory management with pointers becomes a fundamental part of your optimization toolkit. I won’t say too much about what those optimizations are because this answer is long enough, but it basically boils down to the fact that adding more abstraction to make it easier to work with the language comes with a performance cost (e.g. <a href="https://benchmarksgame-team.pages.debian.net/benchmarksgame/performance/mandelbrot.html" rel="noreferrer" target="_blank">see this website here running a benchmark in different languages</a> and compare C++'s performance with Java or Python 3). A consequence of all this is that a lot of “old code” you might still have to interact with today (say, operating system-level code on Unix or Windows) will be using pointers, meaning that pointers will still be a valuable part of your toolkit.</p>
<p><img alt="" src="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/d/db/Barplot_language_speeds_%28Benchmarks_Game_Mandelbrot%29.svg/1024px-Barplot_language_speeds_%28Benchmarks_Game_Mandelbrot%29.svg.png"/></p>
<p>Now when you’re operating at this level, <strong>array decay specifically is a convenient way to pass around sequential data as pointers</strong>. If there wasn’t anything like array decay, then you’d basically have to implement it yourself if you wanted to do anything with arrays - which is asking for weird and subtle errors to occur (on top of the other weird and subtle errors that already occur at this level).</p>
<p>Would be interested in other staff members’ thoughts on “what’s the point of pointers”!</p></div>

Project 2 gitlab setup error
<p>I was attempting to setup my project tonight, I was having no issues until I ran the "git push -u origin main" command, I keep getting an error and I'm not sure how I can fix this</p>

<p>It looks like your remote branch has some changes you haven't pulled to your local branch yet! Try "git pull" first, then do the command again.</p>

Autograder result
Hello! I just saw the results of my private tests, which turned out to be 20/24. I don't understand why simple functions such as sum and count failed. I would really appreciate it if I can get some insight on why there were such errors on the autograder.

-------------------------------------------------
<p>I noticed you didn't have any test cases for sum() in your submitted code. Although it might seem like some functions are trivial, bugs can be very subtle and the only way to be sure they work as expected is to test them with a variety of input.</p>


<p></p>


<p>I would recommend writing a few diverse test cases and see if you can replicated the bug on your end. As a hint, I believe your function will produce the correct output for a vector like {2,-1,0}. What are other types of values you can try passing in? Think about the data type being passed in.</p>


<p></p>


<p>For count, you are missing an edge case. Hint: take a look at the RME for count. What is different compared to most of the other functions?</p>


<p></p>


<p>Feel free to drop by office hours if you want to discuss writing thorough test cases.</p>

-------------------------------------------------
I actually had 3 test cases for sum and 2 test cases for count. I will try to see if I can figure out the bug.

Team up with 3 people
<p>Hi, I read the syllabus and it says for the project we can do pairs. I'm wondering if there is any chance we can do a team of 3 people? Since we decided to be in the same team, but as the requirement says that we have to do pairs. It is very awkward to separate people here. So, I just want to ask. Thank you.</p>

How to read in ppm file from istream in Project 2
<p>I've been working on Project 2 and am stuck on the Image_init function that reads a PPM file from istream. I read the write-up, but I don't understand how to use &gt;&gt; to read-in the file. Are we supposed to use specific functions like getLine from the istream? I have ideas about how to process the file, but I'm just really confused on how to actually obtain it from istream. </p>

-------------------------------------------------
<div class="markdown" id="q38kRj58oo0ooY"><p>If you imagine the <code>istream</code> to just be <code>cin</code>, it acts in the same way as though you were reading the file from user input. Does that answer your question?</p></div>

-------------------------------------------------
<p>So each time you use is&gt;&gt;string_variable or is&gt;&gt;int_variable, the value stored in the variable would be the next string or int separated by a whitespace? Or does it read more than that?</p>

-------------------------------------------------
<div class="markdown" id="q38kRj58oo1ooY"><p>Yep! Just like <code>cin</code></p></div>

P2 Allowed to use "using namespace std"?
<p>Are we allowed to include "using namespace std" at the top of our Matrix.cpp file? Or should I just do std:: next to everything (for example, std::cout)?</p>

-------------------------------------------------
<p>youre allowed to use that everywhere</p>

-------------------------------------------------
<p>To augment the student answer, it's considered bad practice to include "using namespace &lt;anything&gt;" in a .h file (since then if someone down the road includes your library, you are forcing them to use that namespace which could cause naming conflicts). Other than that, you should feel free to to include that statement in any .cpp file.</p>

variable length array
<p>I wrote in void Matrix_init():</p>


<div>
<div>  const int size = width * height;</div>
<div>  int data[size] = {0};</div>
</div>


<p></p>


<p>but when I tried to compile it, there is an error says:</p>


<p>error: ISO C++ forbids variable length array ‘data’ [-Werror=vla]</p>


<p></p>


<p>What can I do?</p>

-------------------------------------------------
<div class="markdown" id="q38kRj58oo0ooY"><p>Since width and height can change depending on user input, the value of size can change from run to run. C++ forbids this. In order to make an array, you must have a constant int size that’s the same for every run of the program.</p></div>

-------------------------------------------------
<p>How is it possible to use a seam array, as its length would depend on the input image's height? Do you have to dynamically allocate memory?</p>

-------------------------------------------------
<p>You don't have to dynamically allocate memory, in this case, you can declare a seam array that is dependent on the height. In the case of data[] though, since it is part of a struct object, the size of data[] has to be the same for all matrices.</p>

-------------------------------------------------
<p>I am getting this same problem, and I am not sure that these posts helped me understand what is going on,</p>


<p></p>


<p>writing in my  seam carve width method</p>


<div>
<div></div>
<div>  const int b = Image_height(img);</div>
<div>  int arr[b];</div>
</div>



<div>I get yelled at with "ISO C++ forbids variable length array"</div>



<div>What is going on here? I made b a constant! shouldn't this be fine? </div>

-------------------------------------------------
<p>Use MAX_MATRIX_HEIGHT as the size for the array. It guarantees that the seam will always be long enough for the image.</p>

Question regarding setup for project 2
<p>I'm looking at the project 2 spec and at the Setup section ("Commit and submit" specifically), it says to "submit the code you have to the autograder. It's best to find out early if there’s a mismatch between the autograder and your local development environment". </p>


<p></p>


<p>When I submit to the autograder and get the results, what exactly am I trying to look for? Whether the code compiles? What would I see if there was a mismatch?</p>

-------------------------------------------------
<p>What this part of the spec is referring to is that some development environments may overlook certain issues that CAEN / the autograder will flag as problematic. For instance, your IDE may not warn you if you are having memory errors but submitting to the autograder certainly will. Essentially we are just promoting the idea of submitting early so that if something looks right on your local computer but has problems in the autograder, you catch this early.</p>

testing matrix.cpp
<p>I am little confused as to how to design my tests in Matrix_tests.cpp. Could someone explain the TEST(&lt;method name&gt;) syntax and how all of the test methods defined in this way are automatically ran without being explicitly called when compiling and running Matrix_tests.cpp?</p>


<p></p>


<p>Also, could someone describe the purpose of the unit_tests_framework.h file? Any help would be appreciated, thanks!</p>

-------------------------------------------------
<p>There is a tutorial page that describes what the unit tests do and what you can do within them here: <a href="https://eecs280staff.github.io/unit_test_framework/" rel="noreferrer" target="_blank">https://eecs280staff.github.io/unit_test_framework/</a></p>


<p></p>


<p>unit_tests_framework.h is a header file for the framework of the unit tests I believe, as in you need this header file to be able to do the TEST(&lt;method name&gt;), ASSERT_EQUAL(first, second), etc. which you must use for your tests in Matrix_tests.cpp.</p>

-------------------------------------------------
<p>Hello! </p>


<p></p>


<p>Referring to slides 15 and 16 in lab 3 (<a href="https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/13a7U67orAdlr05_EtFnOpkdutj-HqEBr_1swx9OTB7s/edit?usp=sharing" rel="noreferrer" target="_blank">https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/13a7U67orAdlr05_EtFnOpkdutj-HqEBr_1swx9OTB7s/edit?usp=sharing</a>) will be helpful!</p>


<p></p>


<p>Mentally, you can view TEST(&lt;method name&gt;) as a function named &lt;method name&gt;. Against this backdrop, each TEST(&lt;method name&gt;) you write corresponds to a function named &lt;method name&gt;.</p>


<p></p>


<p>When you write TEST_MAIN() in the test file, you can view it as an int main function that calls all the functions corresponding to TEST functions. </p>


<p></p>


<p>You need to ensure you import unit_tests_framework.h as a header file to be able to use TEST(&lt;method name&gt;) as the students' answer suggests : )</p>

Somewhat lost on Image_init(Image* img, std::istream& is)
<p>I am unfortunately almost completely lost on this implementation. How should we read an image in ppm? Would anyone give a hint?</p>

-------------------------------------------------
<div class="markdown" id="q38kRj58oo0ooY"><p>Recall the format of a ppm file: <a href="https://eecs280staff.github.io/p2-cv/#ppm-format" target="_blank">https://eecs280staff.github.io/p2-cv/#ppm-format</a></p>
<p>Pretend that <code>is</code> is just typical user input like <code>cin</code>, and use it in that way.</p>
<p>To get the “P3” at the top, you can do <code>is &gt;&gt; blah;</code> where <code>blah</code> is some string variable. Then, you can continue reading in everything else (skipping whitespace) with <code>is &gt;&gt; </code>.</p></div>

-------------------------------------------------
<p>Given that the maximum color value of 255 is already given in image.h, does that mean we should also skip over the 255 present in the PPM format?</p>

-------------------------------------------------
<p>Also wouldn't assigning P3 to a random string variable give a compiler error? The string variable will be unused. Not sure if this will give an issue or not.</p>

-------------------------------------------------
<div class="markdown" id="q38kRj58oo1ooY"><p>When it comes to reading in variables, the compiler won’t complain about it being unused. It will only complain if you declare a variable and do nothing else with it, like <code>int x = 5;</code>.</p>
<p>The max color value will always be 255, so yes, you can just read that in as a junk value as well.</p></div>

Output of &a+1
<p>If a is an array, &amp;a+1 will point to the next object, and we don't need to worry about whether the address is in the half way. But is it true for all other object? </p>


<p></p>


<p>Thank you so much!</p>

-------------------------------------------------
<p>See instructor response in followup.</p>

-------------------------------------------------
<p>Thank you so much! That's a really good explanation! I am sorry I didn't express it clearly for 'the address is halfway'. Here is what I meant.</p>


<p>If a is an integer located in 0x1010, and b is the next object located in 0x1014. What's the code like if:</p>


<p>1) go to the next object after a, which is b?</p>


<p>2) go to the next address of a, which is 0x1011? </p>


<p></p>


<p>I am not sure whether '&amp;a+1' will returns the second output, and '&amp;(a+1）gives the first output. </p>


<p>Thank you so much!</p>

-------------------------------------------------
<p>These are really good questions actually, </p>


<p></p>


<p>First, we cannot put the '&amp;' operator in front of 'a', since a is already an address because it is a pointer. (I assume the compiler wouldn't allow it or there would be strange behavior).</p>


<p></p>


<p>Second, If a is an integer located in 0x1010, and b is the next object located in 0x1014. What's the code like if:</p>


<p>1) go to the next object after a, which is b?</p>


<p>- By doing a + 1, we would be moving the pointer from a to b (from 0x1010 to 0x1014)</p>


<p></p>


<p>2) go to the next address of a, which is 0x1011? </p>


<p>- If a is an array of integers, then this is not possible, since integers are 4 bytes, we can only move from 0x1010 to 0x1014 to 0x1018 etc.</p>


<p>- Now if a was an array of chars (with a char being 1 byte), then doing a + 1 would take us from 0x1010 to 0x1011</p>


<p></p>


<p>If you want some more info, I would highly suggest trying some code in <a href="https://lobster.eecs.umich.edu/" rel="noreferrer" target="_blank">https://lobster.eecs.umich.edu/</a> , this way you can easily visualize memory and where your pointers are going :)</p>

Depending on what file you are trying to run, you just have to add the necessary files!<br/><br/>As for the Makefile warning, this is likely also caused by your compile sources not being configured correctly. Following the same steps as before, double check that your Makefile is not listed as a compile source.</p>

matrix_print
<p>I understand what matrix_print is supposed to do, but I am not sure how to access the contents of the matrix. I read the spec and I tried using a pointer loop with const int* ptr = mat, but nothing seems to be working. Am I missing something or thinking about this in the wrong way?</p>

-------------------------------------------------
<div class="markdown" id="q38kRj58oo0ooY"><p>Without seeing your code, I am not fully sure why your specific approach is not working. Generally, using a pointer to mat could work.</p>
<p>However, I would suggest taking a look at the other matrix functions you will implement. Is there anything you could use to get a pointer to a specific element in the matrix?</p></div>

How do we run the lab code through the visual debugger?
<p>Hi,</p>


<p>For the lab we don't have a "launch.json" file so whenever I try using the vscode visual debugger I first get "the preLaunchTask 'C/C++:g++ build active file' terminated with code -1" and then if I click on "debug anyway" I get launch program '/mnt/c/Users/.../undefined_behavior_simulate' does not exist. I created an empty launch file, but I don't know what to do.</p>

-------------------------------------------------
<p>1. Try copying over the launch.json template from the VS Code setup tutorial. I think you're on WSL based on your filepath (correct me if I'm wrong though), so you'll want <a href="https://eecs280staff.github.io/p1-stats/setup_vscode.html#windowswsl-launchjson" rel="noreferrer" target="_blank">this one.</a> You'll want to copy this into .vscode/launch.json in your Lab 3 folder.</p>


<p>2. Change "program": "${workspaceFolder}/stats_tests.exe" to "program": "${workspaceFolder}/<strong>&lt;name of executable you want to debug&gt;</strong>.exe"</p>


<p>3. Now, in a remote WSL window of VS Code, try running the debugger.</p>


<p>Hope this helps!</p>

-------------------------------------------------
<p>EDIT: Solved. I realized I need to click on (gdb) Launch instead of the regular launch on top right.</p>


<p></p>


<p>Hey, I tried doing that but I still get the two errors (the preLaunch task ... terminated with code -1, and, simulate does not exist, and when i hit debug anyway I get, " '/mnt/c/Users/.../simulate' does not exist". I am not sure what's wrong. I'm attaching a picture of my launch.json.</p>

Matrix row question
<p>How are we supposed to do this function if we are not allowed to use a loop? The spec says these functions (row and col) should not use a loop. </p>


<p></p>


<p>also what if there is more than one number in the array. ex: two 5s in different rows. what would we return then</p>

-------------------------------------------------
<p>Instead of using a loop to find the index, think about how we have a pointer as a parameter in the function which we can use to help find the index (pointer arithmetic). A good example of this in use would be slide 10 on the lab 3 slides. This finds the index.</p>


<p></p>


<p>Then, you must figure out which row it may be in. Something else you may need to help understand which row or column it should be in is the example 5x3 array in the spec. Specifically how the indexes fit with the rows and columns those elements are in. Since it is a 1-D array, the rows and columns are all fit into one array.</p>


<p></p>


<p>I found this easier to find when I wrote Matrix_column before Matrix_row.</p>

XCode Build Error
<p>I'm not sure if this is an issue or not since all my files run fine on the terminal and my submission to the autograder compiles, but I get these buildtime errors when I try to build the project on xcode: </p>


<p></p>


<p></p>


<p><img alt="Screen_Shot_2022-09-17_at_9.03.11_PM.png" src="/redirect/s3?bucket=uploads&amp;prefix=paste%2Fkt03b21o5gb43b%2Fb098db7e77f7cf3e4148f9929c4b1bdfe80cb555262902f5c9d68694e9ff359a%2FScreen_Shot_2022-09-17_at_9.03.11_PM.png"/></p>

-------------------------------------------------
<p>if it runs fine on terminal and autograder compiles it should be fine for the cases you have tested. That error for duplicate symbols (if I recall correctly) happens if you have multiple .cpp files in your build. Only build your driver function and include the .h files for the other relevant files.</p>

Project 2 setup
Do we have to edit the launch.json argument line before we start project 2?

-------------------------------------------------
<p>You don't *need* to edit launch.json before you can start writing/compiling/running P2, but if you want to debug P2, you'll need to update the "program" argument in launch.json to point to the right executable.</p>

-------------------------------------------------

------------------------@662-------------------------
XCode Arguments
<p>I'm currently following the part of the project 2 setup where you edit the arguments and options, and I'm confused on what arguments we're supposed to add here: <img alt="Screen_Shot_2022-09-17_at_9.15.44_PM.pngNaN" src="/redirect/s3?bucket=uploads&amp;prefix=paste%2Fkt03b21o5gb43b%2Fc07ecd8ae650b38d0b2becae9cab3bedde2dba0a0ebe50595befb690930fdb07%2FScreen_Shot_2022-09-17_at_9.15.44_PM.png"/></p>

-------------------------------------------------
<p>the arguments you pass in will be anything that you would like the program to read in (what would otherwise need to be put in the command line) upon running the program. <br/>For p2, that would specifically be these:<br/><br/><img alt="image.png" height="145" src="/redirect/s3?bucket=uploads&amp;prefix=paste%2Fkeh92yraprb5zo%2Fdac19ab1f61b9dc7d471706fab1df0bb4cdd6b4e640efd0aa7a3fb3f557321f6%2Fimage.png" width="455"/></p>


<p></p>


<p>List those out (as if you would put it in the command line) into XCode under "arguments." I recommend you experiment with it a bit with cout statements and to see how it works.</p>

Private test grading
Before the deadline my score was 9/9 and all the functions passed the test on my computer. But I got marked down with some of my functions in the private test for the final grade. So, I want to know how us the private test section graded and what to look for in order to get full points for my private tests for the future projects. Does it mean that my test cases weren’t able to expose some of the bugs?

-------------------------------------------------
<p>We test a wide array of inputs in order to see how resilient your program is and if it works as promised. In order to pass the private test cases you will need to think creatively about what valid edge cases might be able to break the types of functions or programs you are implementing and writing tests that handle those cases. If you are not passing all the privates it means that your test cases were likely not able to expose those bugs (since they were found in your program).</p>

<p>Hi,</p>


<p>Every time I open my vscode, there is a pop up window. What should I do? And if I chose cancel, there are errors in my project 2 such as Matrix.cpp(I didn't made any changes) , which there shouldn't. I had used Xcode to write c programs before, maybe that's the case? Also, my make clean command suddenly doesn't work for my project 1 on Tuesday, are they related? Thank you!</p>

Pass/Fail grade
<p>Hi!<br/><br/>I don´t need this class for my degree but I want to eventually take EECS 281. Will this class count as a pre-req if I choose to convert my grade (&gt;C) to pass/fail at the end of the semester?</p>


<p></p>


<p dir="rtl">Thank you!</p>

-------------------------------------------------
I would recommend you to check with your advisor to find out, the course faculty might not be aware of that.

-------------------------------------------------
<p>Combining the students' answer and the follow-up discussion, you should first read through the prerequisites for EECS 281 on Atlas and then talk to your advisor about how to incorporate the prerequisites into your schedule : ) </p>


<p></p>


<p>Speaking from personal experience, the academic advisors are super helpful in answering questions about fulfilling prerequisites and whether or not P/F works!</p>

-------------------------------------------------
<p>Atlas says you need 280 no pass or fail. Also if you did not already know, you need to take 203. </p>

SSH Keys setup
<p>Hello, I wanted to generate SSH keys, but the outcome is different comparing to the tutorial. It starts with SHA256 instead of <code>ssh-rsa</code>, <code>ssh-dss</code>, <code>ecdsa-sha2-nistp256</code>, <code>ecdsa-sha2-nistp384</code>, <code>ecdsa-sha2-nistp521</code>, <code>ssh-ed25519</code>, <code>sk-ecdsa-sha2-nistp256@openssh.com</code>, or <code>sk-ssh-ed25519@openssh.com</code>. What should I do next? By the way, it says "Publicly visible private SSH keys can compromise your system." What does this mean and do I need to make any changes?<img alt="" height="214" src="/redirect/s3?bucket=uploads&amp;prefix=paste%2Fl7hywh90dp86nx%2F62785fe5f7d447d7eb18a552a680e75f41b5e486d436a29cfbd674719c0b0ceb%2F20220918001742.png" width="835"/></p>

-------------------------------------------------
<p>The sequence of characters following "SHA256" is your key's fingerprint, which is different than the key itself. If you want to see the actual key, <code>cd</code> into your .ssh directory, and run the command <code>cat id_ed25519.pub</code>. Just make sure you don't share your private key and you should be fine</p>

How to check the matrix is a valid matrix
<p>In the requirement, it says mat points to a valid Matrix. I know that it is good to write assert to check the requirement. But how can we check that? </p>

-------------------------------------------------
<p>Hello! </p>


<p></p>


<p>You're right! Using assert statements to check the conditions in the REQUIRES clause is a great practice. However, some conditions like whether mat points to a valid matrix cannot be checked using assert statements : )</p>


<p></p>


<p>I have attached a line from the "Assertions" subsection of the "Matrix Module" in the specification (<a href="https://eecs280staff.github.io/p2-cv/#assertions" rel="noreferrer" target="_blank">https://eecs280staff.github.io/p2-cv/#assertions</a>):</p>


<p></p>


<p>" Of course, you can’t assert every single thing in the REQUIRES clause. Some of them can’t possibly be checked. For example, you can’t check that a pointer points to a valid <code>Matrix</code> (i.e. one that has been initialized). "</p>


<p></p>


<p>Hope this helps!</p>

How to use mat in the Matrix_ init function
<p>My partner and I are having trouble understanding how to use the mat variable in the Matrix_init function. We tried to make a matrix using an array, but we don't know how to make mat point to that matrix. Some guidance would be appreciated. Here is our code:</p>

-------------------------------------------------
<div class="markdown" id="q38kRj58oo0ooY"><p>I would suggest taking another look at how the Matrix struct is defined in <code>Matrix.h</code>. Here, you can see that there are three member variables (<code>width</code>, <code>heigh</code>t &amp; <code>data</code>) where <code>data</code> is a 2D array already allocated to <code>MAX_MATRIX_WIDTH</code> by <code>MAX_MATRIX_HEIGHT</code> dimensions. In <code>Matrix_init</code>, you are passed a pointer to a Matrix where your job is to “Initialize *mat as a Matrix with the given width and height.” Given that <code>data</code> is already initialized, you just have to handle the other member variables.</p>
<p>Feel free to follow-up with clarifications!</p></div>

-------------------------------------------------
<p>So would I have to access the width and height member variables within the struct and change their values to whatever the input is?</p>

-------------------------------------------------
<div class="markdown" id="q38kRj58oo1ooY"><p>That would make sense to me! Then you would have access to the actual width &amp; height of that matrix moving forward.</p></div>

-------------------------------------------------
<p>Ok, this is starting to make more sense to me now. However, I have one more question. The initializer function isn't supposed to create a 2D matrix, it just sets a width, height, and size to be used later on by the other functions correct?</p>

-------------------------------------------------
<div class="markdown" id="q38kRj58oo2ooY"><p>Yes! - if you refer to the Matrix.h file, data is already pre-allocated with the maximum matrix dimensions.</p></div>

-------------------------------------------------
<p>Ok, I understand now. Thank you very much for your help!</p>

Scope of functions
<p>Can I call a function that is declared below another or is it out of scope? For example: calling Matrix_width or Matrix_height in Matrix_init</p>

-------------------------------------------------
<p>you can call them</p>

For Matrix_init(), are we supposed to resize mat->data as well?
<div class="markdown" id="q38kRj58oo0ooY"><p>Hi, so I was wondering if we were supposed to change the actual size of the underlying array as well, which has a size of 500*500 by default. My initial guess says yes, but I wasn’t sure because the public test cases weren’t testing for them.</p>
<p>Thank you!</p></div>

-------------------------------------------------
<p>If you look at the EFFECTS clause of Matrix_init() in the Matrix.h file, it says</p>


<p>"Initializes *mat as a Matrix with the given width and height."</p>


<p>This is all you need to do : )</p>


<p></p>


<p>Every matrix created will have an underlying unchanging data array of size 500*500</p>

How to access for the 2D-array through mat pointer
If I want to access for the element in row p and column q, can I use mat->data[p * q] or use mat->data[p*width+q] to access for it?

-------------------------------------------------
<p>You can consider a 3x2 matrix.</p>


<table border="1px" cellpadding="6px" cellspacing="0"><tbody><tr><td>0, 0</td><td>0, 1</td></tr><tr><td>1, 0</td><td>1, 1</td></tr><tr><td>2, 0</td><td>2, 1</td></tr></tbody></table>


<p></p>


<p>Turning it into a 1D array</p>


<p>    0        1         2        3       4        5</p>


<table border="1px" cellpadding="6px" cellspacing="0"><tbody><tr><td>0, 0</td><td>0, 1</td><td>1, 0</td><td>1, 1</td><td>2, 0</td><td>2, 1</td></tr></tbody></table>


<p></p>


<p>If you want to access the (1, 1) matrix data (i.e. p=1, q=1), you should get 3 as your position. Using this you can find the pattern.</p>

-------------------------------------------------

------------------------@690-------------------------
matrix_at clarification
<p>When the function is called, do we assume that the row/column start at zero or one? I.e. should matrix_at(mat, 1, 1) return the value in the 1st row and column? Or is it the 1st index (which would technically be the value of the second column/row)</p>


<p></p>

-------------------------------------------------
<p>Matrix is 0 indexed, and matrix_at(mat, 1, 1) would return a pointer to the value at row_index 1, column_index 1</p>

how do we print an element of matrix?
<p>is there a command or function that helps?</p>

-------------------------------------------------
<p>I am not entirely sure if I get your question. But, there is the Matrix_print() function that needs to be implemented and then you may call that function whenever required. </p>


<p></p>


<p>To print the matrix, you would need to access each element in the matrix and print it out.</p>
<p><br/></p>
<p>[EDIT: Add on by Adviti Mishra] : I’m not entirely sure of the reason you want to print an individual element. If you are asking this question because you want to print out a particular value in the matrix for debugging purposes, I would encourage you to use the visual debugger : ) </p>


<p></p>

-------------------------------------------------
<p>like can i say os &lt;&lt; mat[row][col]?</p>

-------------------------------------------------
<p>No that won't work. (Sorry if im wrong about anything) but my understanding is that mat is a pointer to a struct with 3 members: width, height, and the data array. You shouldn't look at mat itself as a matrix but instead that it has members containing information <em>about</em> a matrix. To get the matrix we have to find a way to convert the 1-dimension "data" array within mat into a 2-dimension matrix (there is info about this in the spec).</p>


<p>To get access to the elements of the data array you need to dereference the pointer mat and point to the data array, then you can index into whatever value you need from the data array. there's multiple ways to do this but it can be done with the -&gt; operator. i.e. mat-&gt;data(i) would get the ith index of the data array. Remember since data is a 1-d array you can't index into [row][col] like a matrix. I hope this helps</p>

-------------------------------------------------
<div class="markdown" id="q38kRj58oo0ooY"><p>That’s correct, check out the instructor solution in case this is for debugging purposes. If not, another way would be to use the Matrix_at function that you may have implemented.</p></div>

-------------------------------------------------
<p>I am trying to implement the second part of anonymous calc's answer about dereferencing the pointer mat and then make a pointer to the data array. I am trying to do this in my Matrix_at function, however, I am confused on how to derefence mat. I was thinking something like:</p>


<p></p>


<div>
<div>Matrix dereference = *mat;</div>
</div>

-------------------------------------------------
<p>*mat would dereference mat but you inevitably would need to access one of its members, you can do this in two different ways. they both do the same thing.</p>


<p></p>


<p>(*mat).data[i]</p>


<p>This one first dereferences mat (see *mat), which you can now treat like a struct. You use the dot operator "." to access its members - in this example I used data (.data) . And since data is an array you might want to index into it which you do by using the square brackets. ([i])</p>


<p></p>


<p>mat-&gt;data[i]</p>


<p>does the exact same thing as above, but substituting the * and . operators for the arrow operator "-&gt;" this dereferences mat and accesses a member.</p>

-------------------------------------------------
<p>This is a great consideration! However, C++ is smart enough to recognize the type of pointer that is being used (in this case an int *), and will consider the size of the specified type when doing pointer arithmetic. In other words, you wouldn't have to divide by 4 as it is taken into account when performing "ptr - (mat-&gt;data)"</p>


<p></p>


<p>So if ptr is at address 1000 and you run ptr++, if the ptr is an int ptr it will go to address 1004, not 1001. Again, good thought but sometimes C++ will do the hard work for us.</p>

-------------------------------------------------
<p>Oops I think line 64 has an error, and it should be return i % Matrix_width(mat); which I think should correctly return the column number</p>

Matrix_Print
<div class="markdown" id="q38kRj58oo2ooY">Rendering markdown...</div>

-------------------------------------------------
<p>I had a similar issue. instead, you should try int *ptr = &amp;(m-&gt;data); This should get the address you're looking for. I think this is because when you use the -&gt; operator you dereference the m into a struct and then access the data array. Although since you don't actually access the array it should theoretically just give you the address of the first element in the array. Not sure why but adding the ampersand worked for me. Hopefully an instructor will clarify</p>

-------------------------------------------------
<p>in this case, m is a "pointer to const", meaning that whatever m is pointing to cannot be modified (including the data array). You could declare it as a <code>const int *</code> to fix this. What the student suggested actually shouldn't work, because <code>&amp;(m-&gt;data)</code> will give you a pointer to the whole data array, and dereferencing this pointer will give you the array, which decays to the <em>address</em> of the first element.</p>

<p>All this function is doing is comparing your seam to the seam we're expecting. We're outputting your seam to a file and reading in our seam from a file, the function then compares those two.</p>

Matrix_init help
<p>From my understanding, *mat is an object/pointer. I am confused on how to modify *mat. Also I am unsure how to initialize the matrix without using variable length arrays. <img alt="" height="1438" src="/redirect/s3?bucket=uploads&amp;prefix=paste%2Fksyntjtu1l910h%2F4934af7b50d6c3916cac4231aed0c5e169151acd12bc813e6fd57474eb10e6b3%2FScreen_Shot_2022-09-18_at_11.24.16_PM.png" width="2504"/></p>

-------------------------------------------------
<p>Remember that you can use the arrow operator (-&gt;) on "mat" to access any of the Matrix functions or member variables. For instance, if there was a name variable on Matrix, you could set the name in matrix_init by writing "mat-&gt;name = "Joe".</p>

How to test Image_print()
<p>I'm trying to test my Matrix_print function in the test file by declaring and initializing a Matrix. I respected the interface by using Matrix_init(), but how can I efficiently fill the matrix with random numbers I create without doing "Matrix testMatrix = {2, 2, {numbers I want}};" and breaking the interface? Would I have to use the Matrix_at() function for every array value I input? I feel like that's just inefficient.</p>

-------------------------------------------------
<p>One good way to do this would be to use Matrix_at() in a double for loop (one loop for row, one for column). You could then utilize the rand() function in C++ (<a href="https://en.cppreference.com/w/cpp/numeric/random/rand" rel="noreferrer" target="_blank">https://en.cppreference.com/w/cpp/numeric/random/rand</a>) to fill in numbers or you could declare a vector of the matrix you want (in 1D form) and index that vector inside of your double for loop. There are many other options on what type of numbers you could put in your matrix, and I encourage you to think about some of the edge cases.</p>


<p></p>


<p>There's some other ways that I can think of off the top of my head, but they'll all be equally tedious. However, I would keep in mind that a good test case isn't always large and should be testing one singular part of your program/function.</p>

Remove vertical seam
After I finished copying every element in the img except for the seam element, how do I resize the img?
<br/>
<br/>
Would it be efficient to do Image_init(img, width-1, height) and then loop through every element to copy it into the resized img?

-------------------------------------------------
<p>You will want to make sure that you resize and initialize the image before copying elements into it. Your intuition for using the Image_init function seems reasonable, and you would need to loop through and copy each element as the new image you are copying into is not the same size as the original image before seam removal.</p>


<p></p>


<p>This is a great question, and I think other students could benefit from seeing it. If you feel comfortable, feel free to make it public! You can still choose to keep it anonymous. Hope this helps!</p>

-------------------------------------------------
<div class="markdown" id="q38kRj58oo0ooY"><p>I do not understand the instructors’ answer on this question.</p>
<p>The p2 spec explicitly states: Do not attempt to use <code>Image_init</code> to “resize” the original - it doesn’t preserve existing data in an <code>Image</code>.</p></div>

-------------------------------------------------
<p>This line in the spec is making it clear that resizing the original image will not be enough to copy the right data and take out the seam.</p>


<p></p>


<p>When I say "make sure that you resize and initialize the image", this refers to the smaller auxiliary image that you are copying into. You will still need to loop through all of your pixels and copy them from the original image to the smaller image. But to even make an "empty" smaller image, you will need to call Image_init on it with a smaller width before you begin copying pixels into it.</p>

problems "adding Quickstart to README"
<p>Hi, I'm at the "modify README" segment of the git setup tutorial and it isn't accepting my pull requests after following the instructions outlined in the tutorial exactly. It says that the current branch has no upstream branch.  Specifically, I did git fetch -&gt; git status -&gt; git diff README -&gt; git add README -&gt; git commit -m "Added quick start to README" -&gt; git push; it didn't work. This is to implement the main function into README which I'm not sure is necessary for the project, I just wanted to be safe.</p>

-------------------------------------------------
<p>Try running "git push -u origin main" to set main as the upstream branch for your repository. If this does not work, please respond in the follow ups with screenshots of any further errors.</p>

const confusion
<p>Hi!</p>


<p></p>


<p>I dont understand why you can't perform the folloiwng code.</p>


<p></p>

<p></p>


<p>Why is there an error on the last step? ptr1 can be modified</p>

-------------------------------------------------
<p>There is a difference between constant pointer and pointer to const. Pointer to constant is a pointer where the value it points to cannot be changed, while constant pointer is a pointer that you cannot change where it is pointing to. In this case, it is not allowing you to set a non const ptr to a const object because it is afraid that you'll use ptr1 to alter the object it is pointing to which is const </p>

Matrix_row()/col
<p>Hello,</p>


<p></p>


<p>I am really confused on how to approach Matrix_row()/col. I understand that we have to do pointer arithmetic to get the index of the number, but I do not know how to get the row/col without a for loop approach. Any type of help would be appreciated. Thanks :)</p>

-------------------------------------------------
<p>Think about how the width of the matrix can help you. For instance if the width is 5, then there are 5 elements per row. Indices 0-4 are in row 0, indices 5-9 are in row 1, etc. So once you have the index of the value you want (let's say index 6), how can divison/mod and the width help you get the row/col? </p>

-------------------------------------------------
<p>The div method doesn't work for finding Matrix_col so I was trying to see if using some form of subtraction worked but it doesn't seem to work. Is there a recommendation for approaching matrix_col when it's not exactly a 5x5 or 4x4 (e.g., 4x5)?</p>

-------------------------------------------------
<p>Think about how you can use mod (%) and the width to get the column. It might help to visualize by drawing out a 2D grid and writing down the index of each cell</p>

Testing Matrix_max
<p>We are having trouble testing matrix max because right now the only two values we can initialize the matrix with are the fill and border values and we want to test our function on more diverse values. We tried to initialize the data of the matrix using a loop and set it to the values of the index (so 0-8 for a 3x3 matrix with the goal of returning 8). Is there a way to fill our matrix with many different numbers so we can more properly test max?</p>

-------------------------------------------------
<p>You can use Matrix_at to set specific elements. It returns a pointer to the element at a row/col and you can use it to modify the value of that element.</p>

Should matrix functions be expected to deal with doubles?
<p>Will test cases ever initialize a matrix having a double for the row/column values? An example being a 1.5x1.5 matrix...I know it will round down to a 1x1 matrix, but when I try this my assert statement specifying the parameters being &gt;0 &amp;&amp; &lt;= row/column max values fails. Wondering if I need to find a way around this or if the test cases will only create matrices with whole value parameters?</p>


<p></p>


<p>edit : would this be an example of finding a bug?? from my understanding we should write multiple test cases for each function, some of which will fail meaning they've encountered a possible bug. is this an example of a test case we would want to fail?</p>

-------------------------------------------------
<p>Because the two parameters for Matrix_init are ints, you can assume that anytime the test cases initialize a matrix it will be with integers, not doubles.</p>

Matrix_column and Matrix_row pointer confusion
<p>Hello, quick question about the pointer being passed as the parameter for both functions. Do they contain a value from the Matrix or do they contain an address that points to a value within the matrix? </p>


<p></p>


<p>If it contains an address, how would I use it to find the row and column of the element it points to? </p>

-------------------------------------------------
<p>They contain an address that points to a value within the matrix. Think about how you can use the *mat with the *ptr to find the location. Remember that although we want the matrix to be 2D, underneath the hood it is actually just a 1D array. If I want to represent or pass through an array as a ptr, where in the array is that ptr actually pointing to?</p>


<p></p>


<p>Hopefully that helps out a little bit.</p>

-------------------------------------------------
<p>So is it like this slide explaining the pointer arithmetic but instead the mat* is our array and I use ptr* as the number that is added to it to get the value? <img alt="Screen_Shot_2022-09-19_at_3.17.43_PM_(2).png" src="/redirect/s3?bucket=uploads&amp;prefix=paste%2Fl7np2kap5yu6ql%2F4065625ea49b33037ec5be0130af3dbcaf6de62bffbfcd553f7095576d0b6752%2FScreen_Shot_2022-09-19_at_3.17.43_PM_%282%29.png"/></p>

-------------------------------------------------
<p>Yeah I think you get the idea. In this example *ptr is pointing to 0x1010 and *ptr3 is pointing to 0x1018. If you were given *ptr and *ptr3 and knew that *ptr was pointing to the array but had no idea where *ptr3 was pointing to in the array, think about how you would be able to find the location (or distance) of *ptr3 in the array.</p>

For tests, are we allowed to use the -> operator?
<div class="markdown" id="q38kRj58oo0ooY"><p>I know in the specs it says this:</p>
<p><strong>In particular, no function other than <code>Matrix_row</code>, <code>Matrix_column</code>, and the two versions of <code>Matrix_at</code> should access the <code>data</code> member directly.</strong></p>
<p>Does this apply to writing tests as well? Or are we allowed to directly compare the output Matrix’s fields to the expected values? In particular, I wanted to take a look at <code>mat-&gt;height</code>, <code>mat-&gt;width</code>, and <code>mat-&gt;data</code>.</p>
<p>Thank you!</p></div>

-------------------------------------------------
<p>This does apply to the tests. Respecting the interface is a very important part of this class in general. However, this isn't a major issue as some of the functions you have implemented will do the same thing! For instance, calling Matrix_height(mat) should return the exact same value as calling mat-&gt;height.</p>

Matrix_row()
<p>I am getting a warning from the compiler that "implicit conversion loses integer precision: 'long' to 'int'" whenever I try performing pointer arithmetic on mat-&gt;data and ptr together.</p>

initializer functions in Matrix.cpp, Image.cpp
<p>1. Does Image_init initialize the height and width for the 3 Matrix objects too?</p>


<p>2. Do the Matrix and Image initializers do anything to the data[] array?</p>


<p>3. Is there any way to directly change a certain value in a Matrix? As far as I see, you can only fill all the elements with the same value or modify the border elements.</p>


<p></p>


<p>Thanks.</p>

-------------------------------------------------
<p>1. Not directly, you should just be calling Matrix_init for the 3 Matrix objects. That function should be taking care of initializing height and width for each Matrix already</p>


<p>2. No, you should not be doing anything to the data array in Matrix_init</p>

in the function. What exactly is it asking us to do, or is what I am doing somewhat on the right path?</div>

-------------------------------------------------
<p>Yes you are on the right path, that's all you need to do for Matrix_init!</p>

-------------------------------------------------
<p>Did you mean to say that's all I need, like as in just those two codes or should I continue on that path adding things?</p>

-------------------------------------------------
<p>Is there anything else that needs to be added to the Matrix class that init does? While the matrix will store the data we need, don't we have other functions to do that for us, or for us to set a value given some row and column?</p>

-------------------------------------------------
<p>I'd personally check the Matrix struct, and consider what else we are even able to initialize/store within the matrix for `Matrix_init`, <strong>if</strong> we even can do anything else besides the two lines mentioned above.</p>

-------------------------------------------------
<p>Ah cause I thought I should add something for the third part of the struct which is data.</p>

-------------------------------------------------
<p>Is there any way for us to add data to the matrix struct, `mat`, with the given inputs? </p>

<p>You can use the Matrix_at() function, for exmaple, if you wanted to set the the value at row 0 and column 0 to one, it would be something like:</p>


<p></p>

<p>Your original approach is logically correct, but your Makefile passes some parameters (i.e. -Wall, -Werror, -pedantic) to your compiler to make it report more warnings/errors, and to treat all warnings as compilation errors. In the line of code "index;", the value of index isn't being used for anything, and the -Wall parameter enables warnings for unused values; -Werror treats this warning as an error, hence the compilation failure you were getting. Replacing "index;" with just ";" removes the unused value, and still works because index is passed in as a parameter to the function, and thus is in-scope for the entire function body. Hope this helps!</p>

how to test matrix print using unit testing

-------------------------------------------------
<p>There's an example in Matrix_public_test.cpp (test_matrix_print). Essentially you create an ostringstream for your expected output and then an ostringstream for your actual output (pass this into your Matrix_print function), then compare those two using .str()</p>

Having a hard time to start matrix.cpp
<p>Hi I'm really having a hard time to start this project...I feel like i am so unfamiliar with C++ syntax and pointer that i don't really know where to start....I went to the supplemental tutorial and it made a lot of sense to me...but still...<img alt="" height="1800" src="/redirect/s3?bucket=uploads&amp;prefix=paste%2Fksxfxo1r1f877a%2F274a2b076e88e74d418ddefe6804b5576e5fbd9cf97527c2d5f31019d7cc9a54%2FScreen_Shot_2022-09-19_at_8.39.26_PM.png" width="2880"/></p>

-------------------------------------------------
<p>Let's start with the Matrix_init function. This function takes in a pointer to a Matrix object (the first parameter) - this is the Matrix object that we are initializing. We're given a width and a height, and all we want to do in Matrix_init is set mat's width and height. Remember that with pointers, you have to use arrow syntax to access its member variables (ie. mat-&gt;width). Instead of setting width and height to 500, you want to set it to the width and height that are passed into the function. Does that help? </p>


<p></p>


<p>The rest of the functions follow a similar pattern. You're always given "mat," which is a pointer to the object you'll be working with. For example, in Matrix_width, you want to return mat's width. Recall the definition for the Matrix struct (in Matrix.h):</p>


<pre><span class="hljs-class"><span class="hljs-keyword">struct</span> <span class="hljs-title">Matrix</span>{</span>
  <span class="hljs-keyword">int</span> width;
  <span class="hljs-keyword">int</span> height;
  <span class="hljs-keyword">int</span> data[MAX_MATRIX_WIDTH * MAX_MATRIX_HEIGHT];
};<div class="compile_code"><button class="compile_code_button" data-id="compileCodeBtnId" onclick="return PE.openCodeRunner('c3RydWN0JTIwTWF0cml4JTdCJTBBJUMyJUEwJTIwaW50JTIwd2lkdGg7JTBBJUMyJUEwJTIwaW50JTIwaGVpZ2h0OyUwQSVDMiVBMCUyMGludCUyMGRhdGElNUJNQVhfTUFUUklYX1dJRFRIJTIwKiUyME1BWF9NQVRSSVhfSEVJR0hUJTVEOyUwQSU3RDs=');">run code snippet</button><div class="code_runner_notify">Visit Manage Class to disable runnable code snippets<button onclick="return PE.dismissCodeRunnerNotice();">×</button></div></div></pre>
<p>You can use arrow syntax with the mat pointer to return the width member variable of the Matrix object.</p>


<p></p>


<p>It would also really help to watch/review the lectures on pointers and arrays, and make sure you have a solid understanding of how they work. I would really recommend the Runestone async lectures.</p>

-------------------------------------------------
<p>So do I need to use struct Matrix to get a new matrix before Matrix_init?</p>

-------------------------------------------------
<p>All of the functions have a passed in Matrix so you should be using the given mat to access its member variables in all functions.</p>

-------------------------------------------------

------------------------@744-------------------------
Matrix_column_of_min_value_in_row edge case
<p>Will this function not work for matrices with only one column? One of the requires statements is that column_start &lt; column_end. This implies there must be at least two columns for this function to work. Will we not receive any matrices with only one column or is it a case we should not consider?</p>

-------------------------------------------------
<p>Remember that column_end is the column one PAST the one you want to end at (so it's non-inclusive). So column_start could be 0 and column_end could be 1 in a matrix with only one column.</p>

-------------------------------------------------

------------------------@745-------------------------
Row and column indexing
<p>For the matrix_row and matrix_column functions, do we start indexing the rows and column from 0 or 1? For example if we have a 3x3 matrix</p>


<p>{1, 2, 3</p>


<p>4, 5, 6,</p>


<p>7, 8, 9}</p>


<p>and we have ptr pointing to 8, would matrix_row(ptr) return 3 or 2? Would matrix_column(ptr) return 2 or 1? I have a similar question for matrix_width and matrix_height. If it was a 3x3 matrix would they return 3 and 3 or 2 and 2? In the public tests it seems to be that matrix_row and matrix_column are indexed from 1.</p>


<p></p>

-------------------------------------------------
<p>Both rows and columns are always indexed starting from 0. </p>


<p></p>


<p>In your example, Matrix_row would return 2 and Matrix_column would return 1 (for a pointer to the 8).</p>


<p>However, Matrix_width and Matrix_height would both be 3, because there are 3 elements in each row and 3 elements in each column (you actually count these).</p>

-------------------------------------------------

------------------------@746-------------------------

using functions in Matrix_test_helpers.h
<p>How do we use the helper functions in Matrix_test_helpers.h in Matrix_tests.cpp if we can't directly fill in data[] from Matrix_tests.cpp? Wouldn't this just result in comparing a matrix to itself as we would have to individually fill in the values of both matrices?</p>

<p>Hello!</p>


<p></p>


<p>I'm not entirely sure what you mean when you say "comparing a matrix to itself as we would have to individually fill in the values of both matrices", so please correct me if I misinterpreted your question : ) </p>


<p></p>


<p>For any test case, you have an expected answer (which you hardcode). As you said, you can't directly fill in data[] in Matrix_tests.cpp but you have implemented various functions in Matrix.cpp that might help you with this!  Given the objective of test cases as discussed in labs and lectures, you would then want to check if the expected answer matches what your test case is returning.</p>


<p></p>


<p>The Matrix_test_helpers has two functions. I would encourage you to read the RMEs of each in the Matrix_test_helpers.h file to see how they can help compare your expected values with your actual values!</p>

testing Image_init using dog.ppm etc
<p>Hi,</p>


<p></p>


<p>How can I test Image_init with the various .ppm files? Which stream/syntax would I use for this? Or is this something that will come in processing/resize.cpp and should not be done directly from Image_test.cpp?</p>


<p></p>


<p>Essentially how do I pass a .ppm as a parameter to the istream in Image_init</p>

-------------------------------------------------
<p>You may want to look into creating an <a href="https://cplusplus.com/reference/fstream/ifstream/" rel="noreferrer" target="_blank">ifstream</a> object with the name of the .ppm file, and passing it into Image_init. If you don't want to read in an entire file, you can also create an <a href="https://cplusplus.com/reference/sstream/istringstream/" rel="noreferrer" target="_blank">istringstream</a> object, and pass in your own made-up PPM data as a string. Hope this helps!</p>


<p></p>


<p>Edit: You should only be using stringstream objects (like istringstream and ostringstream) and not ifstream/ofstream. The autograder may not recognize the files you're trying to read in with fstream, so don't use it in your tests.</p>

-------------------------------------------------
<p>I can't figure out how to do this. I tried std::istream dog.ppm and it read an error. How do I do this correctly?</p>

-------------------------------------------------
<p>You don't want to create an istream object. Instead, you want to create one of its subtypes. If you're trying to read from a file, you'll want to use an <a href="https://cplusplus.com/reference/fstream/ifstream/" rel="noreferrer" target="_blank">ifstream</a>. If you want to read from a string (like we do in Image_public_test.cpp), use an <a href="https://cplusplus.com/reference/sstream/istringstream/" rel="noreferrer" target="_blank">istringstream</a>.</p>

PPM requires check
<p>I'm a bit confused as to how we can assert whether an image is in ppm format without comments. Or is there no assert and we can naturally assume that this requirement will be true?</p>

-------------------------------------------------
<p>In EECS 280, you can assume the requires clause of a function will never be violated -- that is, the autograder won't try any inputs that break the requires clause.</p>


<p>It's still good practice to assert requires clauses, but asserting the PPM format is a bit tricky to do meaningfully. A simple check would be to assert the first line of the file is "P3," to indicate it's a "plain PPM file." You could also check that none of the numerical values are negative, and the color intensities don't exceed the specified maximum (which is always 255). Of course, this doesn't promise the entire file is correctly formatted, but I wouldn't worry about robustly checking this invariant.</p>

test cases not deleting previous matrix
<p>I am writing test cases for matrix.cpp, and my test case for matrix_fill_border is failing only because the values I'm not filling are taking data from the matrix i created in my previous test case. I added a "delete matrix;" line at the end of my previous test case but the data in those indexes is still carrying over into my next test case. The matrixes have different names and sizes so I have no clue why its doing that and why the previous matrix isn't deleting. Any ideas would be appreciated!!</p>

-------------------------------------------------
<p>Hello!</p>


<p></p>


<p>If your new operator has a corresponding delete operator in your previous test case, the previous matrix should be getting deleted! </p>


<p></p>


<p>It is always good practice to set ALL the values in your current test matrix to a certain value to prevent a sort of default initialization of values from taking place.  </p>


<p></p>


<p>After you fill your test matrix with a certain value, you can then proceed to test your matrix_fill_border : )</p>

-------------------------------------------------
<p>Hello, I'm having this same issue. I have a delete statement at the end of my previous test cases and I'm still getting junk values in future matrices I declare. Was there ever a solution found to this issue? </p>

-------------------------------------------------
<p>I believe setting the entire matrix to a single value like 0 first might help with the random junk values</p>

Understanding pointer
<p>I am having trouble understanding some stuff about the matrix.</p>


<p>First if we are given const Matrix* mat in a function. How do I pull, I should be able to pull for example the first piece of data by doing mat-&gt;data[0] right? if not how do am i suposed to pull data correctly.</p>


<p>Second in this screenshot am i calling any of the pointer incorrectly?</p>

-------------------------------------------------
<p>You are correct that mat-&gt;data[index] is how you access the Matrix element stored at a given index in the data array.</p>


<p></p>


<p>The goal of the Matrix_column function is to find this index that ptr points to in the data array, and convert it to a column in the matrix.</p>


<p></p>


<p>The spec urges you not to use any loops to determine the column. Instead, I would think of it in the following steps:</p>


<p></p>


<p>1) Find the index in the data array that corresponds to the element pointed to by ptr</p>


<p>2) Determine a formula to convert from the index in the data array to the corresponding column that element would be in for the matrix</p>

column of min value and min value in row
<p>I am having issues debugging these two functions. Basically I tried to initialize a pointer pointing the min with the given row and starting column. However, it only let me use the const int pointers to initialize and I wanted to use int pointers because I will be changing what the mins point to. My code keeps defaulting to the matrix_at function that returns a const int pointer even if I choose the one that just returns an int pointer. I know this is because in the input for these two functions the matrix is const. </p>

Why are you using pointers?
<p></p>
<div>Sorry, that wasn’t helpful, I was just wondering if there was something that made you want to use them — I personally did not use them here. Anyways, you don’t need to worry, I think you are overthinking implementation, simply iterate through the allowed columns in the single row, and then keep track of the smallest value you have seen so far as an integer. For the one that returns the column, just keep track of the column of the min you have seen so far. It should be a for loop with an if statement.</div>

-------------------------------------------------
<p>I was doing traversal by pointer to go through the row and find the smallest value. </p>

-------------------------------------------------
Ah, I think I might see where you are overthinking it (also I updated my reply, sorry for being slow on that). Remember that you should use Matrix_at whenever possible, so just use a simple for loop that calls that function every time, and dereference it to keep the integer value.
<p></p>

Const matrix_at testing
<p>If we already tested the matrix_at() function, and since we can not make a const matrix as a test case without initializing it and putting data into it (because of it being const), do I need to make a test case for this function?</p>

matrix max
<p>Confused on how to approach the matrix_max function. Any tips on how to go about finding the max value?</p>

-------------------------------------------------
The data is really a 1D array, iterate through it and keep the biggest value. Then return that. In other words, a for loop with an if statement inside.

-------------------------------------------------
<p>You should approach the problem as iterating through each element in the 2D Matrix, saving off the max, and returning it. You will want to use the other Matrix functions such as Matrix_height, Matrix_width, and Matrix_at to accomplish this.</p>

-------------------------------------------------
<p>Are we allowed to reference values from the 1D array in matrix in this function, or do we need to go through the other matrix functions? The guidelines say that</p>


<p></p>


<p>"<strong>In particular, no function other than <code>Matrix_row</code>, <code>Matrix_column</code>, and the two versions of <code>Matrix_at</code> should access the <code>data</code> member directly – call one of these functions instead."</strong></p>


<p><strong></strong></p>


<p>Can we just find the max value of the array in the matrix directly? (i.e. calling (*mat).data[4] )<br/></p>

-------------------------------------------------
<p>Good catch! You should use the other matrix functions to iterate through the 2D matrix and find the max. I would not recommend directly accessing mat-&gt;data.</p>

Seam
<p>Hi,</p>


<p></p>


<p>How do you initialize a seam in the function seam_carve_width. We need to input a stream when calling find_minimal_vertical_seam and I am confused as to what to put in the parameter and how to initialize it. I tried setting the seam equal to the size by doing </p>


<p></p>


<p>int seam[Image_height(img)]</p>


<p></p>


<p>but this returns the following error. Can anyone help?</p>


<p></p>


<p></p>

-------------------------------------------------
<p>Just had the same error, tried something online, it worked at first then ended up giving a memory leak. What I'm using now is a line of code provided in the processing_public_tests.cpp file, which initializes the array as int seam[MAX_MATRIX_HEIGHT]. Seems to work alright.</p>

-------------------------------------------------
<p>I did this and it works. However, the REQUIRES clause for the remove_vertical_seam method which needs to be called after this requires that the size of array equals height of matrix. not that it's &gt;= height of matrix. any idea how to get around this?</p>

-------------------------------------------------
<p>Right I was worried about this too, I am thinking that was a mistake, I'm not sure how they would even check that. The reality is that there is no way to actually check the size of an array that is passed in:</p>


<p></p>


<p><a href="https://eecs280staff.github.io/p2-cv/#assertions" rel="noreferrer" target="_blank">https://eecs280staff.github.io/p2-cv/#assertions</a></p>


<p>"Of course, you can’t assert every single thing in the REQUIRES clause. Some of them can’t possibly be checked. For example, you can’t check that a pointer points to a valid <code>Matrix</code> (i.e. one that has been initialized). You also can’t check that the size of an array parameter is large enough, since it’s actually turned into a pointer parameter by the compiler and doesn’t know its size."</p>


<p></p>


<p>So I want to leave this unresolved so maybe we get an answer to this question, but personally, I'm not gonna do anything about it because I think that its fine. They literally initialized it this way in their public tests, so I don't think its not a big deal if they did it too (don't worry this is starter code it's not breaking rules to post this):</p>

mat.size
<p>Would a matrix.size() be allowed or even work</p>

-------------------------------------------------
<p>Well, if you know width and height, then you know the size, don't you?</p>

-------------------------------------------------
<p>The only elements of a Matrix struct that are accessible with a . operator are width, height, and the data array.</p>


<p></p>


<p>Since there is no size function defined for the matrix struct, matrix.size() would not work.</p>


<p></p>


<p>As the student follow up suggests, the width and height of a matrix are set in Matrix_init, and should be returned in the Matrix_width and Matrix_height functions respectively.</p>

-------------------------------------------------
<p>What about the functions that ask you to return them? I assumed you didn't know those values thus you have to figure it out using functions such as .size().</p>

-------------------------------------------------
<p>No those values are set when you initialize, in Matrix_init, and in those functions, e.g. Matrix_width, you simply access that part of the Matrix struct with -&gt;, does that make sense? I think .size() is a vector specific function, there is nothing going on behind the scenes in our case, we get to set everything ourselves. If you are still wondering where the initial width and height come from, those have to be set by the user or some input.</p>

How do I get breakpoints to run?
<p>I am writing test cases for Image.cpp and I added a breakpoint to one of my functions. It is not hitting the breakpoint when I run the test file. How do I get it to do this?</p>

-------------------------------------------------
<p>Yeah as instructor said, our code won't stop because it isn't really that smart. You need to <strong>set up the launch.json file</strong> and then <strong>specify which executable you want it to debug</strong>, and then include the breakpoint in the code (you could set the breakpoint before doing the other stuff, order doesn't matter). I'm not sure which IDE you are using, but you should go to the setup tutorial for how to use the debugger. I am including a link to the VS code debugger tutorial here: <a href="https://eecs280staff.github.io/p1-stats/setup_vscode.html#debug" rel="noreferrer" target="_blank">https://eecs280staff.github.io/p1-stats/setup_vscode.html#debug</a></p>


<p></p>

-------------------------------------------------
<p>Breakpoints are for using the debugger! They won't stop your program when you are running it normally.</p>

Accessing width and height Member in struct Matrix

<p>I see that there are restrictions on accessing the member "data" in struct Matrix, are there any restrictions on accessing the member "width" and "height" also?</p>

Rgb values
<p>For each rgb value, is it guarenteed that they will be from 0 - 255 (inclusive)?</p>


<p></p>


<p>I read the spec and it said for the Image module "Each Pixel includes three integers, which represent red, green, and blue (RGB) color components. Each component takes on an intensity value between 0 and 255." I was going through the RMEs as well and couldn't find any part where the Pixel object is even created.</p>

<p>This is from Image.h, does this answer your question? </p>

-------------------------------------------------
<p>The requires clause of Image_init indicates that any image you read in will be in valid PPM format, which is described in this screenshot of the spec.</p>

Check for where you might be accidentally indexing out of bounds. Hmm, I don't want this to be misleading, the point isn't that you put the ball in a place it can't get to, you just told it to check out a place it can't look at.</p>

Public test question
<p>im just trying to run the public tests yall gave us but i had a question, aren't I always gonna fail this since the matrix gets filled with 0's then there is an</p>


<div>
<div> int *ptr = Matrix_at(mat, 2, 3);</div>
<div>  ASSERT_EQUAL(Matrix_row(mat, ptr), 2);</div>
<div>this would fail always because even though *ptr is set to the last index on the matrix there is also a 0 in the beginning and of course everywhere else. So why would we assert_equal that the row that ptr is in which is every row is correct at row 2. Or is the matrix row and column supposed to return the last row or column that the element is in?</div>
<div>
<div>
<div></div>
</div>
</div>
</div>


<p></p>

-------------------------------------------------
<div class="markdown" id="q38kRj58oo0ooY"><p>The test you are referring to is asserting that the <code>int *ptr</code> obj is pointing to the second row of the matrix. The Matrix_row function should return the row a ptr is pointing to. See the link below for how a 2d matrix is represented in this project.
<a href="https://eecs280staff.github.io/p2-cv/#implementation" target="_blank">https://eecs280staff.github.io/p2-cv/#implementation</a></p></div>

-------------------------------------------------
<div>
<div>int *ptr = Matrix_at(mat, 2, 3);</div>
<div>yes this is setting the pointer to point at this value, the value is 0</div>
<div>so if doing<br/><div>
<div>ASSERT_EQUAL(Matrix_row(mat, ptr), 2)</div>
<div>this would be the same if doing</div>
<div>
<div>
<div>ASSERT_EQUAL(Matrix_row(mat, 0), 2)</div>
<div>which since all the elements in the matrix are 0 then Matrix_row(mat, ptr) will return the row that has value 0 in it first, which would be the very first row since the whole matrix is 0's.</div>
</div>
</div>
</div>
</div>
</div>

-------------------------------------------------
<p>ptr is pointing to a specific item in the matrix, not just a value. Yes, the value at 2,3 is 0, but the pointer is talking about that zero specifically. </p>


<p>Those two assert statements would not be doing the same thing.</p>


<p>The Matrix_row function returns what row that specific item is in.</p>

Problem with Image_init and "is >>"
<p>I read the earlier post about using "is &gt;&gt;" for the Image_init function in Image.cpp. I followed the instructions in the spec and the code does make sense to me when I read it. However, when I went to test it with the Image_public_test, it fails.</p>

-------------------------------------------------
<p>So you have the right idea with the &gt;&gt; operator, but currently, your implementation only reads a couple words/numbers of the whole ppm. To fix this, consider a way we can implement the I/O iteratively for every number in the PPM file.<br/>As for the -1094795586 value, I'm not sure what cout statement that is corresponding to, but a quick run with the debugger should solve that issue.</p>

init  function purpose ?
<p>Hey , So with the init function am I trying to just make a blank array that will serve as a blank matrix of the specified dimensions. If so what is the purpose of the pointer.</p>


<p></p>


<p>Or am I making it so that the pointer given is the address of the first element in our blank array therefore matrix that will be constructed using the dimensions provided</p>


<p></p>


<p></p>


<p>Or is it something else .</p>


<p></p>


<p>Pls help.</p>

-------------------------------------------------
<p>The init function just takes in the <span style="text-decoration:underline">already made</span> matrix and sets its width and height in the matrix struct. That's it, just like 2 lines of code.</p>


<p></p>


<p>In general, what you'll have is some code in a different file altogether that says the following:</p>


<p>Matrix* mat = new Matrix;</p>


<p>int width = 5;</p>


<p>int height = 6;</p>


<p>Matrix_init(mat, width, height);<br/>...</p>


<p>...</p>


<p>delete mat;</p>

-------------------------------------------------
<p>So then what do we do with the pointer ? </p>

-------------------------------------------------
<p>The pointer is the address of the matrix. At this address is the home of a matrix, which has the matrix struct. To get all the matrix's stuff to him, you need to follow this address, and then deliver this stuff. That looks like this:</p>


<p></p>


<p>mat-&gt;width = width;</p>


<p></p>


<p>You use the pointer to deliver the information.</p>

-------------------------------------------------
<p>Like do we need to pass by pointer and input matrix data when we call the  init function? or are we just calling this function to make a blank matrix of the desired size. Like what doe we need to use mat for ?</p>

-------------------------------------------------
<p>No init is very simplistic, really. You don't need to multiply, or prepare cells, or put data in, nothing like that. Nothing even to do with any arrays. Init uses no arrays, anywhere. Init is just used to label the matrix's home with the values of the matrix width and the matrix height.</p>

-------------------------------------------------
<p>So we are calculating the width , height , and matrix size using the function inputs and then using the pointers to deliver those values to a struct at that address?</p>

-------------------------------------------------
<p>There won't be any calculations necessary, but that's the idea. Imagine the init function as a delivery person, it just takes the prepared information of matrix width &amp; height from someone, and it delivers it to the matrix object that was created, so now the matrix knows the integer value of width &amp; height. It is quite simply just the following (with an analogous line for height that is almost exactly the same, if I wrote that part here I would literally be sharing the entire Matrix_init function, without the assertions):</p>


<p>mat-&gt;width = width;</p>

-------------------------------------------------
<p>Also, if it helps, calling "Matrix *mat = new Matrix;" does not specify the width and height of the array, it only initializes the structure and it's members. That's where the Matrix_init() function comes into play; setting specifically what the members of "mat" are.</p>

-------------------------------------------------

------------------------@780-------------------------
-> pointers
Can someone kind of explain how we use -> with pointers?

-------------------------------------------------
<p>That's how you input something into a struct that you only have the address for (the pointer for).</p>


<p><a href="https://www.tutorialspoint.com/cplusplus/cpp_member_operators.htm" rel="noreferrer" target="_blank">https://www.tutorialspoint.com/cplusplus/cpp_member_operators.htm</a></p>


<p>This link gives examples, but in p2 terms, this is how:</p>


<p>int width = 5;</p>


<p>mat-&gt;width = width;</p>


<p></p>


<p>Where mat is a Matrix type object, which has the member "width".</p>

-------------------------------------------------
<p>You can think of the <kbd>-&gt;</kbd> operator as equivalent to dereferencing a pointer and then using the <kbd>.</kbd> operator to access a member of the object being pointed to.</p>


<p></p>


<p>In other words, <kbd>ptr-&gt;x</kbd> is equivalent to <kbd>(*ptr).x</kbd></p>


<p></p>

completely lost on image_init
<p>I can't figure out how to use an istream passed in through image_init and read it, the instructors said somewhere else to create a separate istream object with the same name but I don't know how that even works. How do I even get all the individual numbers using cin? I tried looking through the lecture notes but it just prints out each individual word I don't know where it's stored.</p>

-------------------------------------------------
<p>So, you don't want to cin anything, I actually don't know what they were talking about with a separate istream object, that doesn't sound like it belongs inside our Image_init implementation. Anyways, it's just a little trick that they hinted at in the specs:</p>


<div>
<div>is &gt;&gt; filetype &gt;&gt; width &gt;&gt; height &gt;&gt; max;</div>
<div>Read in stuff just like this. The "is" is the input stream passed into the function, so you can literally just type this line into your code and it will work. You'll need to declare the variables before this line, so something like std::string filetype; and be sure to #include &lt;string&gt; at the top. Also, for the reading in of the pixel data, use the following in a for loop (you'll also need to declare these):</div>
<div>
<div>is &gt;&gt; red &gt;&gt; green &gt;&gt; blue;</div>
<div>And then pass each thing into img. This trick is somewhat hard to find on your own, so I wanted to just share it outright. I don't think it counts as dishonesty, may the instructors strike it down if they think it is. You also won't need cout here, if you were considering that.</div>
<div>The reason the trick works is that the arrows will essentially skip past white space, tabs, and new lines, meaning they just collect the information that is useful, like words and stuff. It's like magic!</div>
</div>
</div>

-------------------------------------------------
<p>As the student response mentions, you can essentially treat an <code>istream</code> object like it is a <code>cin</code> and read in input using the <code>&gt;&gt;</code> operator. Instead of getting input from the user from the standard input device (like a keyboard), <code>istream</code> takes information from an existing file and feeds it into your program, as if it was coming in via <code>cin</code>.</p>


<p></p>


<p>And it is pretty magical! You don’t really have to worry about spacing, new lines, etc. - your program will know where you last left off in reading in info, so you can pick right off the next time you use <code>&gt;&gt;</code>.</p>


<p></p>

-------------------------------------------------
why do we need to declare the variables before this line, so something like std::string filetype??
<br/>
Why can not I  use like below?
<br/>
is >> width >> height;

-------------------------------------------------
<p>Well... you need the variables used for width and height; or else, where will you store the information?</p>


<p></p>


<p>As for string type, the first line in the example PPM file in the specs has "P3" which is a string type.</p>


<p></p>


<p>How can you collect this info and store it in a string variable?</p>


<p></p>


<p>The same way:</p>


<p></p>


<p>string file_type;</p>


<p>is &gt;&gt; file_type:</p>


<p></p>


<p>**wonder if we can use namespace std</p>

-------------------------------------------------
<p>If you use this line , "is &gt;&gt; red &gt;&gt; green &gt;&gt; blue;" the variables cannot be pixels because the complier does not allow this, so would it just be ints? And if it is, how would you put the ints into the get pixel function considering it only takes Pixels?</p>

-------------------------------------------------
<p>I have this same question! I tried creating a temporary Pixel variable, reading in red, green, and blue as ints, and then setting each one to tempPixel.r (or .g, or .b) but then how do you indicate the specific color when you call Image_set_pixel?</p>

-------------------------------------------------
<p>Yeah, red, green and blue are ints. For each of the red/green/blue values, you need to change the values in the respective channels for each color. I don't know how much I can say without this getting flagged for cheating, but use Matrix_at with each of img's channels in a nested for loop. </p>

-------------------------------------------------
<p>That being said I'm sure you can make a tempPixel as someone else said that they did that and it worked. Either way prob works.</p>

compute_energy_matrix question
<p>For the compute_energy_matrix function, let's say I have a 3 x 1 matrix (3 rows and 1 column). What would happen then since there's no index where the element is a "non-border" element? How would the energy matrix look like?</p>

-------------------------------------------------
<p>This situation would end up with all entries having a value of zero. However, even though it is not explicitly said, this case should never happen.</p>

-------------------------------------------------

------------------------@783-------------------------
Image_init with istream
<p>In the Image_init function where you pass in an istream, are we supposed to be filling the red_channel, green_channel, and blue_channel of the Image or are we supposed to be using the Pixel struct for something in this function. A little confused about what this function is asking us to do besides to initialize the image with the given width and height. </p>

-------------------------------------------------
Soo... the answer to this is a little complicated. In this one, you are going to actually read in all of the data and stuff from a .ppm. See
<a data-pats="post_ref" href="781" onclick="return PE.gotoPost('781');">@781</a>
 for some tips for how to do that. In case you want some more hints, here you go:

<ol><li>You will probably want to use a temp Pixel variable</li><li>You will want to use the Image_set_pixel function</li><li>You will want to use the other Image_init function inside of the Image_init function</li><li>You'll want a 2D for loop</li><li>You'll really want to use the tip in <a data-pats="post_ref" href="781" onclick="return PE.gotoPost('781');">@781</a></li></ol>

-------------------------------------------------
<p>You're on the right track! As per the RME for Image_init, this function is supposed to initialize an Image based upon the values in the istream, which holds a representation of an image in <a href="https://eecs280staff.github.io/p2-cv/#ppm-format" rel="noreferrer" target="_blank">PPM format</a>. Since this PPM file contains preset RGB values for the various pixels of the image, you'll definitely want to make use of these values to initialize your image.</p>

debugger not running properly
<p>Hi. My visual studio code's debugger isn't working well, and it keeps popping up this warning when I tried to compile it. I have the correct launch.json file with the file name replaced with the one I was working with ( during the lab it was simulate.exe). Really need some help for this, thanks!<img alt="" height="902" src="/redirect/s3?bucket=uploads&amp;prefix=paste%2Fksvq0z62mb279r%2F7c473faf7064b34df7c523062b1bfcb2090cf5f2be4dc801aa10a1f5229e4da2%2FScreen_Shot_2022-09-20_at_5.08.14_PM.png" width="916"/></p>

-------------------------------------------------
<p>Which directory is the launch.json in? Typically you are going to want to make a new one in your project directory and then copy and paste the launch.json template from the debugging setup.</p>

What is matrix_print supposed to print exactly?
<p>I am very confused by the rme of matrix_print. I get the first line, but the second line makes no sense to me. What does "print the rows of the matrix to os with one row per line. each element is followed by a space and each row is followed by a new line." mean? </p>


<p></p>


<p>The matrix public test did not seem to help me too much. Why does it call matrix_at? I thought someone said to implement the functions in order so how are we supposed to do matrix_print? </p>


<p></p>


<p>I just don't necessarily get what is supposed to be printed out.</p>

-------------------------------------------------
<p>So, lets say we had a matrix like this:</p>


<p><img alt="image.png" height="74" src="/redirect/s3?bucket=uploads&amp;prefix=paste%2Fkw74v59av4w2bg%2Faa27b354b71a12aac3e5a00bd5b08cd4453d93e49862dbc0bc45b0c15223659a%2Fimage.png" width="74"/></p>


<p></p>


<p>What do we want to print?</p>


<p>We want to print the following (2 2 is width and height of the matrix):</p>


<p>2 2</p>


<p>1 2 </p>


<p>3 5</p>


<p></p>


<p>Now, it may be unclear where the spaces are, so I'll make it more clear. Here, a "_" means a space:</p>


<p>2_2</p>


<p>1_2_</p>


<p>3_5_</p>


<p></p>


<p>Also I don't know who said to implement them in order, Matrix_at is very useful in this. You'll need a 2D for loop that goes through the row and column dimensions, using Matrix_at to retrieve the value at that entry, then give that to the output stream.</p>

style check
for project 2, is is true that if we pass the style part in the autograder, we will get full points for the style?

-------------------------------------------------
<p>Yes, there is no other style check as there was in 101, for instance.</p>

std::ostream& os in Matrix_print function
<p>I am confused as to why I am getting this error because I thought we were supposed to use "os" instead of "cout"?</p>

matrix border fill edge case question
<p>Two separate questions below:</p>


<p></p>


<p>When there is a matrix that only has one row, do I only fill in the far right and far left side columns with the specified variable?</p>


<p></p>


<p>When there is a matrix that only has two rows, do I only fill in the far right and far left side columns with the specified variable on both rows?</p>

-------------------------------------------------
<p>No you'd just fill the whole thing up in any thing that has 2 or less for a height or width value.</p>

-------------------------------------------------
<p>So all values in the array should be equal to the value that is passed in the parameter for the fill border function  if height &lt;= 2 or width &lt;= 2  </p>

-------------------------------------------------
<p>Yes</p>

<p>Seems like you might have some undefined behavior. Do you have all the sanitizer warnings enabled? What I mean is that your code could be accessing parts of memory that are not marked as safe, so sometimes they are overwritten, and sometimes they happen to be there when you look at them. It would be the equivalent of getting lucky.</p>

-------------------------------------------------
<p>Hmm, I am not using address sanitizer. Do you know how I can use address sanitizer with the make command?</p>

<p>From the setup:</p>

<p></p>


<p>I know someone was having a problem with the environment part, so if that causes issues, then you probably don't need it (I just realized I didn't have it enabled but sanitizer errors still show up).</p>


<p></p>


<p>Edit: Also I personally didn't just copy and paste the CXXFLAGS line that they had, I made sure the line in my makefile included the previous flags and the flags from that line (so I put all the flags, basically). Idk if that's bad honestly, but it has worked so far. Also I just put the environment stuff in and it worked fine.</p>

<p>Thank you!</p>

weird number for red channel initialization only
<p>When I am initializing my image's channels (red, green, blue), the red channel does not initialize properly, but the green and blue channel initialize properly. The red channel initializes with a very large negative number except for the last element in the array, but the green and blue channels are initialized with all zeros. I am using the exact same code for all 3 channels. Anyone have any idea why this is happening?</p>


<p></p>


<p><img src="https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/1019786858001088512/1021969287138779169/1.png"/><img src="https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/1019786858001088512/1021969287533035540/1.png"/></p>

-------------------------------------------------
<p>I had the same problem, I got help in OH and it was because I did not initialize each rgb channel in my first Image_init function. You have to do it in both of them, or at least I did. </p>

-------------------------------------------------
<p>If you make a <span style="text-decoration:underline">private</span> post with your Image_init code, that might help us figure out what might be going wrong!</p>

Using Matrix_test_helpers
<p>After writing a plethora of tests, I am a little bit unclear about how to use the Matrix_test_helper functions. Is it required to use these? I am specifically confused as to how the Matrix_equal one would be useful. Would we have to create two Matrices at once? And what would the array_equal one do if this interface of the matrix really being an array is abstracted away from the user anyway and we have to respect the interface in the test file?</p>

-------------------------------------------------
<p>I have also been very curious about this. I looked around in the files because I remembered that matrix_equal was used somewhere, and it is being used in the processing public tests. Within this file, they have a load_matrix function that reads in a matrix from a file. Now, I think we could probably steal this from them and put it at the top of matrix.cpp (I actually don't know if that would cause an error or not, we def cannot edit matrix.h because we are not submitting this), or just manually make a matrix and set each entry using *Matrix_at(mat_correct, row, col), but that seems hard. I'd rather just use the print function to compare them. Anyways, I have no clue why the array equals function would be useful, indeed any arrays have been abstracted beyond our reach and we are literally forbidden from accessing the data array outside of matrix.cpp: "Using member variables directly from the outside messes this all up. Don’t do it! It could break your code and this will be tested on the autograder!"</p>


<p></p>


<p>Anyways would be nice to hear from an instructor about this</p>


<p></p>

-------------------------------------------------
<p>You are definitely not required to use these functions, you are more than welcome to though if you want. </p>


<p></p>


<p>To use Matrix_equal, you would have to create two Matrices: one that you're testing on and one that has your expected output.</p>


<p></p>


<p>We primarily use Array_equal to test seams for processing. This would probably be the only scenario I would use it in.</p>

-------------------------------------------------
<p>I’m also hoping to hear the answer to this one. Thank you! </p>

Matrix print
<p>May we use loop function on matrix_print?</p>


<p><img alt="Screen_Shot_2022-09-21_at_9.31.25_AM.png" src="/redirect/s3?bucket=uploads&amp;prefix=paste%2Fkyjgk5364g37nt%2Fc619abb787aacea335ea50d77825a858aa1e1f591926d014e4d7a5a87b136cf5%2FScreen_Shot_2022-09-21_at_9.31.25_AM.png"/></p>

-------------------------------------------------
<p>Using for loops for something like Matrix_print is perfectly fine! You have to access/print every element of the matrix for this function, so doing it with a for loop makes a lot of sense.</p>


<p></p>


<p>For function like Matrix_at, Matrix_row, Matrix_column, you really only care about a single element of the matrix, so we just want to warn that using a for loop for these functions is not necessary and will potentially cause slow runtime.</p>

weird number for red channel initialization only
<p>As a follow up to my previous post, this is private and below is my code for both Matrix_init and Image_init.</p>


<p></p>


<p><img alt="" height="167" src="/redirect/s3?bucket=uploads&amp;prefix=paste%2Fl7c84hh3kqv3cf%2Ff8f5a8b4d24545bbfe20aae27b78ff452f4169f2869ea7e01211f6ea0d5e361d%2F1.png" width="574"/><img alt="" height="236" src="/redirect/s3?bucket=uploads&amp;prefix=paste%2Fl7c84hh3kqv3cf%2F58066bd71847d915f7eab8624c4a2d84390ee4cdcc17044b544492f4c7107568%2F2.png" width="500"/></p>

-------------------------------------------------
<p>Looking at your code it seems like you are placing a 0 at the end of the data array and not modifying the rest of it. Remember, arrays are given a size upon initialization (the values inside the array are undefined by default). Take another look at the description for Matrix_init and see if you are doing what is required by the function.</p>

-------------------------------------------------
<p>But I found that even though its set to zero, why do the green channel and blue channel fill up completely with zeros while only the red channel is the one thats odd?</p>

-------------------------------------------------
<p><img src="https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/1019786858001088512/1021969287138779169/1.png"/><img src="https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/1019786858001088512/1021969287533035540/1.png"/></p>


<p></p>

-------------------------------------------------
<p>I actually wouldn't worry too much about this. All the Matrix_init and <span style="text-decoration:underline">this</span> Image_init functions are asking you to do is initialize the given Matrix/Image with the given width/height (per. the RME for these functions). We don't have any expectations of what the values are in a Matrix data array until they are externally specified (for example via. Matrix_fill, Matrix_at, etc.).</p>


<p></p>


<p>That said, for the other version of Image_init which also takes an input stream as a parameter, you will be initializing the RGB channels with specific values. </p>

uncaught exception of type problem
<p>When I try to run my matrix_tests, it shows problems like this. How can I solve this?</p>


<p><img alt="image.pngNaN" src="/redirect/s3?bucket=uploads&amp;prefix=paste%2Fksyu583mfo13ie%2F43da4753769fd738e4d464fd57b8837b113361a694557d18d8f5118e2fbecd6f%2Fimage.png"/></p>

-------------------------------------------------
<p>I think this means you need to have your test names not have any periods in them. If you named your test <code>train_small.csv</code> try naming it <code>train_small_csv</code>.</p>


<p></p>


<p>If that doesn’t work, try making sure your <code>TEST_MAIN()</code> is below all of your tests (the tests must come first).</p>


<p></p>


<p></p>


<p>Edit: train_small.csv was an example of a file that is passed into a project 5 executable -- did you write the name of this file in your launch.json or in your command line at any point? If so, this would be causing a problem. Instead of writing the name of this file anywhere, you'll want to use files like horses.ppm, and horses_400x250.ppm. Here's a screenshot of what you'll want (assuming I'm right about your error, anways):</p>


<p><img alt="image.png" height="50" src="/redirect/s3?bucket=uploads&amp;prefix=paste%2Fkw74v59av4w2bg%2F0eacf53406a86bb8a37b54dede057157e4ab7357887a4b0d46709315c01e194b%2Fimage.png" width="767"/></p>

<p>Anyways, my guess is that you copied something from the setup that was just an example, but not exactly what you would need.</p>

-------------------------------------------------
<p>were you able to figure out what's going on? if not, please check the follow ups of <a data-pats="post_ref" href="851" onclick="return PE.gotoPost('851');">@851</a> for some suggestions. let us know if it's still not working!</p>

-------------------------------------------------
<p>How would we fix this error then? I'm getting the same problem as well.</p>

-------------------------------------------------
<p>So first check your launch.json, if it has the text "train_small.csv" anywhere in it, first remove that and the "--debug" thing too, and then replace it with the text in the screenshot (I just wrote that by hand, you could just write "a", "b", "c","d", and it wouldn't matter). Now, if you don't see it anywhere, I think that means you are typing "train_small.csv" into your command line, and if so, just don't do that? Just don't type it into your command line and it shouldn't look for it ever.</p>

-------------------------------------------------

Matrix print test

<p>Is it failing because of the spacing? The values themselves are being printed correctly. </p>

-------------------------------------------------
From the output, I believe so, as strings are different if there is a mismatch of the white space. And you may want to check your I/O stream

-------------------------------------------------
<p>Did you end up resolving this issue? My partner and I are having the same problem.</p>

-------------------------------------------------
<div class="markdown" id="q38kRj58oo0ooY"><p>Yeah this is probably a whitespace issue for you as well. You might want to double check that the ‘endl’ and ’ ’ that’s added in your program is the same as specified in the spec. You might also be able to use the <code>sdiff</code> command on the command line to narrow down where the problem’s coming from.</p></div>

-------------------------------------------------
<p>(I am the other partner) and through using Visual Studio Code function to indicate whitespace, it does not seem to be a whitespace issue. This is what we are getting. Is it potentially the last line that may be causing this issue?<img alt="Screen_Shot_2022-09-21_at_4.48.19_PM.png" src="/redirect/s3?bucket=uploads&amp;prefix=paste%2Fky21cpxg1jg5hs%2Ffabea3e43734dd27cbb506d2c99afea202bc00bc125c3b1b275c016a623a6a2c%2FScreen_Shot_2022-09-21_at_4.48.19_PM.png"/></p>

How do I fix memory leaks that occur in the LeakSanitizer?
<div class="markdown" id="q38kRj58oo2ooY"><p>The UB checks on the autograder say that my code has a memory leak every time I do something like <code>Pixel *pixel = new Pixel;</code> and I’m not sure how to fix that (since I do need to instantiate a new object). Would I need to delete the objects at some point to fix this or what should I do?</p>
<p>Additionally, the leak sanitizer won’t work since my compiler claims it does not support <code>-fsanitize=leak</code>, so how should I go about looking for memory leak issues?</p></div>

-------------------------------------------------
<p>Yes, you need to free dynamically allocated memory. Use the delete operator to do that.</p>


<p></p>


<p>This <a href="https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/new-and-delete-operators-in-cpp-for-dynamic-memory/" rel="noreferrer" target="_blank">article</a> might be helpful for you.</p>


<p></p>

-------------------------------------------------
<p>To clarify: any time you use the `new` keyword, you will need to use the `delete` keyword on the object you allocated once you are done using it, to ensure all memory allocated is deallocated, and nothing is leaked.</p>

-------------------------------------------------
<div class="markdown" id="q38kRj58oo0ooY"><p>Alright, I’ve found some places where I can delete the objects but there are methods I can’t change (in public tests) that call <code>Image_get_pixel</code> but do not delete the pixel afterwards. What should I do to avoid memory leaks here?</p></div>

-------------------------------------------------
<p>I don't believe your Image_get_pixel function should return a pointer to the Pixel struct.</p>

-------------------------------------------------
<p>So I get the inclination to use "new" for a new variable of the Pixel type, but that isn't necessary here, just declare it like normal:</p>


<p>Pixel example;</p>


<p></p>


<p>or if you want to define it:</p>


<p>Pixel example = {1, 56, 105};</p>


<p></p>


<p>Hope this helps!! I got similar errors when I tried to new Array, and then I realized it wasn't necessary.</p>

-------------------------------------------------
<div class="markdown" id="q38kRj58oo1ooY"><p>Yeah, I figured as much considering <code>new Pixel</code> causes it to be stored in dynamic memory. I changed it to initialize the Pixel without using new and it worked fine.</p></div>

Image_init and Image_print
<p>Hello,</p>


<p></p>


<p>I have 2 questions about the image.cpp file. For my image_init file, I have been doing img-&gt;red_channel.data[i], but reading the spec again, I am not allowed to do that. I tried to do Matrix_at for this, but then I got stuck on trying to figure out the row and col parameters.</p>


<p></p>


<p>My second question is about the for loop in image_print. I'm pretty sure we have to do a nested for loop with width and height, but I do not know how to progress past that. Any help would be appreciated.</p>

-------------------------------------------------
<p>So for your first question, as it is mainly a syntax question, I will just give you the syntax answer:</p>


<div>
<div>Matrix_init(&amp;img-&gt;red_channel, width, height);</div>
<div>Now, I think they actually gave us this line to use in the specs, but in the first Image_init, I want to remind you that you are just initializing the width and height of the image, and all of its matrices. You will use this syntax a lot in many functions, specifically &amp;img-&gt;red_channel.</div>
</div>


<div>For question 2, I would suggest writing Image_get_pixel first, and then using that for the output of three different parts of the pixel to the ostream (but the 2D for loop is right, good job!)</div>

matrix max const
<p>currently working on matrix max, iterating thru data 1d array to find the max value. but because the matrix is a const, i can't do it the way i am used to, since i can't assign a variable(max) to a value of data. if i make max (the variable) a const, i can't change it later if i find a higher value. am i missing something simple? </p>

-------------------------------------------------
<p>A very common "max" algorithm is to keep track of the largest value you have seen so far:</p>


<div>
<div>    if(example[i]&gt;max){</div>
<div>      max = example[i];</div>
<div>    }</div>
</div>


<div>You'll have to initialize max to some value, typically either a really low value (negative, so like -2000000000), or to the first value of the array, and then subtract one from that value. You won't need to modify the matrix at all, and max can be overwritten (max is not a const).</div>

-------------------------------------------------
<p>Yup, this is exactly what I am trying to do. But VS Code is telling me "expression must have class type but it has type "const Matrix *"</p>


<p>Maybe something else is wrong here. </p>

-------------------------------------------------
<p>Ok do you have this line and it causes errors?</p>


<div>
<div>max = mat-&gt;data[i];</div>
</div>

-------------------------------------------------
<p>oh my god i just realized i wrote mat.data and not the arrow. thanks !!</p>

<p>Happy to help! :)</p>

Newline
<p>How do we do a newline? I wrote </p>


<p>os &lt;&lt; endl; </p>


<p>for matrix_print but it's coming up as an error.</p>

-------------------------------------------------
<p>"\n"</p>

-------------------------------------------------
<p>Make sure the code surrounding that line does not have any errors. (missing `;` or `{` or some symbol) Since `os` will be some `ostream` object, that would be fine to use with `endl`. Another thing is to make sure you are including the proper namespace when working. (Since `endl` is not in the `iostream` library, but rather `std`)<br/><br/>EDIT: Additionally, you can use the newline character, as the student describes above.</p>

array passed to function

As is shown in the list of variables, there is only a "*seam".</p>


<p>Even if I assign *seam with 1, the point is, the array seems to lose its size. In the main function, it was assigned with size 500, but when passed into the function, it only shows one space with value 0, and doesn't change anymore. For example, while I'm debugging, in the main function , the seam is shown as an array with size 500:<img alt="1663707785534.png" src="/redirect/s3?bucket=uploads&amp;prefix=paste%2Fl7jqibclt6ten%2Fd3ead30b4abf2e569486a6e1b122d667d1f1ea82846f373cb917fe9d3e0f768c%2F1663707785534.png"/>.When I step into the function, <img alt="1663707816758.pngNaN" src="/redirect/s3?bucket=uploads&amp;prefix=paste%2Fl7jqibclt6ten%2F18c43920aeeaf02bc9ee02f94cc823735aa1f5d017a2442690a612ffb23dd2d0%2F1663707816758.png"/>the seam changed.Even when I try to assign"seam[0] = 1;seam[1] = 2;", nothing changed,there still shows"*seam = 0"</p>

-------------------------------------------------
<div class="markdown" id="q38kRj58oo0ooY"><p>This should be fine. Basically when you pass the array into the function, you don’t pass in any information to indicate how long it is. Because of that, the debugger cannot assume that your array is of length 500, and so it defaults to just showing the dereference of the first element.</p>
<p>Note that when you pass in the array like this, array decay occurs and you really get an <code>int *</code>. So all the debugger can assume it has in this state is a pointer, not the entire array. Does that make sense?</p></div>

-------------------------------------------------
<p>But when stepping out of this function, the seam[] has not be changed, and the program failed.</p>

-------------------------------------------------
<div class="markdown" id="q38kRj58oo1ooY"><p>Ah that’s different then. Just to make sure is this after compiling the code and running again (just to make sure you’re not running on out-of-date code)? <code>seam[0] = 1</code> should overwrite the value in <code>seam[0]</code>.</p>
<p>It’s a little hard to judge based on only what you’ve provided, so you may want to hop into office hours so someone can take a closer look.</p></div>

Matrix fill
<p>Would I use a nested for loop for the matrix fill and matrix fill border functions?</p>

-------------------------------------------------
<p>That works! I did that for the fill border, I just realized I did what instructor hinted it for fill, and I could have done it for fill border but I was lazy.</p>

-------------------------------------------------
<p>No you do not need nested for loop. Think about what is the data structure that "data" uses. Is it 2-dimensional?</p>


<p>We introduced that you may move pointers by doing some math so the pointers point to some other elements in the array. You may want to apply the idea here.</p>

resize error message
If we fail to open the file and the argument is not 4 or 5, will we need to print 2 error messages(usage one and error opening one)?

-------------------------------------------------
<p>From the spec, "Your program should then exit with a non-zero return value from main. Do not use the exit function in the standard library, as it does not clean up local objects."</p>


<p>For the two errors you mentioned, which one is checked first? If that error was triggered, what the program should do? Will it even check the potential second error?</p>

-------------------------------------------------
So will the file open or not be the first check and arguments be the next?

-------------------------------------------------
<p>I would check the arguments first, then check the files</p>

-------------------------------------------------
But If I can not open the file, how can I check the arguments that whether the width and height are in between 0 and original file?

-------------------------------------------------
<p>1. check arguments 2. check open files 3. check the width and height requirement.</p>


<p>1 &amp; 3 are not checked in one step.</p>

-------------------------------------------------
So for the step 2, would we first check the input file then the output file?

-------------------------------------------------
<p>The general idea here is check when you need. When you need to open some file, verify if you can successfully open it.</p>

<p>The midterm and final will both be online exams that can be taken remotely on your laptop. It's a combination of multiple choice, short answer, implementing functions, matching/fill in the blank... quite a variety, but that makes it a little more digestible to sit through, in my opinion!</p>

Xcode error

-------------------------------------------------
<p>Do you see this error if you manually run "make Image_tests.exe" from the terminal? If so, make sure you don't have more than one main() function in your P2 code (in resize.cpp), and that you aren't including any .cpp files -- you want to define each function once in a .cpp file, and include it everywhere else using only the .h file it's declared in. Hope this helps!</p>

-------------------------------------------------
<p>When I run "make Image_tests.exe" in my terminal, i get "make: 'Image_tests.exe' is up to date.". I also have only one main() function in my resize.cpp file. Still unsure what the problem is.</p>

-------------------------------------------------
<p>Gotcha, that's a good sign if you're able to do it from the terminal. Are you able to run your Image tests from the terminal, too? Try "./Image_tests.exe" -- if it runs without any issues (i.e. all the tests either pass or fail), then the issue is probably with how XCode is set up, rather than your code. I'm afraid I don't know XCode super well, so my recommendation is to just build/run from the terminal; there might be an option to open a terminal window inside XCode to make things more streamlined, kind of like how VS Code does it...</p>

-------------------------------------------------
<p>This should be a relatively quick fix. My guess is you don't have the correct configuration for your compile sources. To fix this, I would refer to <a href="https://eecs280staff.github.io/p1-stats/setup_xcode.html#compile-with-xcode" rel="noreferrer" target="_blank">this</a> section of the setup guide which walks through how you set-up your compile sources in P1. Since you are running Image_tests, make sure you have the Image_tests.cpp, Image.cpp, and Matrix.cpp files <span style="text-decoration:underline">only</span> included as compile sources. You may also have to add the Image_test_helpers.cpp file if you are using those functions in your test.</p>

-------------------------------------------------
<p>I'm getting "</p>


<p>Assertion failed: (false), function Image_init, file Image.cpp, line 13.</p>


<p>zsh: abort      ./Image_tests.exe"</p>


<p>which I think just means that the assertion failed because I haven't started on the Image.cpp functions. I don't think there's a way to open a terminal window in XCode but I'm not sure</p>

<p>Hello! I just need some clarification on "os" in Matrix_print(). Is "os" an output text file object we use to print the Matrix, or is it something else?</p>


<p></p>


<p>Edit: I did some research and since "cout" is an object of "ostream", when we call Matrix_print(), the second parameter of Matrix_print() would be "cout", correct?</p>

-------------------------------------------------
<p><code>ostream</code> works like <code>cout</code> similar to how <code>istream</code> can be a replacement for <code>cin</code> when reading in a file (so you can just print to <code>os</code> like <code>os &lt;&lt; "hello!"</code>. Yes, if you wanted to call <code>Matrix_print()</code> somewhere in your code and print to console, you would pass in <code>cout</code>.</p>

Project 1 private tests
<p>Hi,</p>


<p></p>


<p>Just a piece of feedback to the course as a student. The general point of assignments, (exams, projects, HW, etc.) is to test my learning and see where I'm lacking so that I can improve. If I did something wrong, I want to understand why it is wrong and what I should've done instead. In the case of private tests, I just know that I did something wrong. Not why or how it was wrong. Without this information, I'm not sure how to improve and not make the same mistake in the future.</p>


<p></p>


<p>I get that it's policy that's been in place for years, but I feel like it's counterintuitive to be unable to learn from my mistakes. Also, I am not just mad or angry about P1, I only lost 1 point in the private tests which I am perfectly fine with. I just felt like sharing my thoughts because it is frustrating to know that I am wrong and not know why, and I'm sure that I will experience the same feelings in the future. </p>


<p></p>


<p>Thanks for your time. </p>

-------------------------------------------------
<p>Hi Sumer! I totally understand wanting to learn from your mistakes and continuously improve on your coding skills. We keep the private tests hidden so that they aren't shared with next semester's students which makes them not so private.</p>

When are we allowed to use mat-> to access the struct directly?
<p>I'm under the impression that within Matrix.cpp we can only use mat-&gt;data in four functions. Namely, Matrix_row, matrix_column and both Matrix_at. Additionally, we should only use mat-&gt;width/height in Matrix_width and Matrix_height. In all other cases we should be calling the previous functions (Matrix_at/width/height) to accomplish the task. Is this correct, or do we have freedom to use mat-&gt; wherever we want within Matrix.cpp?</p>

<p>Oh you can use that whenever, since it is within the matrix module, you are always allowed to use mat-&gt;data and mat-&gt;width and height. It might be considered bad practice, but you can always do that inside of matrix.cpp. Outside of it, you should never use it.</p>

-------------------------------------------------
<p>For structs, the members are <code>public</code> by default. That means you can always do mat-&gt;width, but this doesn't mean it is good practice trying to get the members directly (later in the class, you will see why we need <code>class</code> which solved this issue to some extent).</p>


<p>I think in your Matrix.cpp whenever you need to get the width, feel free to use either mat-&gt;width or Matrix_width. Outside Matrix.cpp, it is better practice to just use Matrix_width. Same for the height. You may notice whenever you use mat-&gt;width, you have the ability to write the value (the write permission could be dangerous sometimes), but with Matrix_width, you can only read the width but cannot write the value (safer when you only need to read).</p>

question of Matrix_column and Matrix_row
<p>when I am doing matrix_coumn and matrix_row, I used "ptr - mat-&gt;data" to calculate the distance between the pointer given and data[0]. But whe I am dubugging, it shows that the distance is a number which is totally far away from the number I want to get. How can I solve this?</p>


<p></p>


<p><img alt="image.png" src="/redirect/s3?bucket=uploads&amp;prefix=paste%2Fksyu583mfo13ie%2F171955b0813d89e9c8adc680a29710e7516818bb75e1c563bce7377dd4287113%2Fimage.png"/></p>

-------------------------------------------------
<p>Is that the initial value or the value after the line is run? I mean that in the debugger, it will display some random value from what was stored in memory while it highlights the line of code that will reset it. Only once it gets past this line has it set it. As far as your code itself goes, I have the same line and it works, so you can rest assured knowing that your code is fine.</p>

-------------------------------------------------
<p>Like the student said, before the variable gets initialized, it just contain whatever lived on that memory address. It could be some junk value left by a previous program.</p>

-------------------------------------------------
<p>I also use this same line of code, but am getting the warning that "Implicit conversion loses integer precision: 'long' to 'int.' It still compiles, but should I be concerned about this and how it will run through the autograder?</p>

-------------------------------------------------
<p>You shall be good with just  ptr - mat-&gt;data.</p>


<p>The default data type for this is long which is long int, and long has a larger range than int which is why you may get the warning. You can also explicitly transfer the data type by doing something like</p>


<p><code>long a = 10;</code></p>


<p><code>int b = (int) a;</code></p>


<p>In this case, you won't get such warnings for the second line.</p>

Perf Mac Equivalent
<p>When submitting to autograder my program keeps timing out on horses, due to this I am trying to find the inefficient part of my project, the spec suggests we use perf to find this. However, after researching, perf is only available on linux, are there any suggestions for what I can do if I am on mac? </p>

-------------------------------------------------
<p>You can use the CAEN linux computers, it looks like they have perf installed on them.</p>

-------------------------------------------------
<p>In addition to the student answers, it looks like there are equivalent tools on macOS -&gt;https://stackoverflow.com/questions/23200704/install-perf-on-mac. For students on windows, you should still be able to install perf and then run the program from the base folder. </p>

<p>A couple things to check: Matrix_at gets called multiple times throughout the program; are you looping to find this value? Try also removing the assert statements when running your program; they can be helpful for debugging, but they can cause your program to slow down if you are doing a check for every single pixel multiple times throughout the process.</p>

Matrix_at type error with const int* and const int

<p></p>


<p>We are dividing a const int* by a const int, and were wondering if it is a problem with the / symbol, or if we just need our types to both be const int or both const int*.</p>

-------------------------------------------------
Dividing pointer by integer, I think that is not allowed. I would suggest subtracting another pointer from the first pointer to get an integer difference, if you know what I mean.

-------------------------------------------------
<p>Remember that the value of a point is an address, and an address is something like 0xbfdb70f0. Think about why division or multiplication does not make sense for addresses (The start address of an array is not necessarily 0x0, and it can change every time you run your project.), but we can do additions and subtractions (with some limits).</p>

about matrix_at
<p>Hi i have a few questions about Matrix_at:</p>


<p></p>


<p>1. which pointer are we looking at? Is it mat? Do i need to create a ptr myself?</p>


<p>2. I know how to do the arithmetic to transform 2d-1d index but a pointer's value is an address, how do i edit that? I know that i can use row and column and width/height to get the 1d index, but after that what kind of command should i use to get the address of that object and let our ptr point to it?????</p>


<p>3.What's the difference between</p>


<p></p>


<p><b>int</b>* Matrix_at(Matrix* mat, <b>int</b> row, <b>int</b> column)</p>


<p></p>


<p>and</p>


<p></p>


<p><b>const</b> <b>int</b>* Matrix_at(<b>const</b> Matrix* mat, <b>int</b> row, <b>int</b> column)</p>


<p></p>


<p>like, what do they mean by pointer-to-const?</p>


<p></p>


<p>I am so unfamilier with c++....Geez this is so hard for me...</p>


<p></p>


<p>Thank you !!!</p>

<p>1. <span style="text-decoration:line-through">The pointer is mat</span><span style="text-decoration:underline">[The pointer that we want to return is not a pointer points to a Matrix]</span> and it is passed in to the function. You will have to return a pointer, <span style="text-decoration:line-through">so just use the &amp; to reference whatever thing it is "at"</span>[<span style="text-decoration:underline">No you don't want to use either reference or dereference operators, it is pointer arithmetics</span>].</p>


<p>2. It sounds like you are really close, here is some pseudo-ish code to help you:</p>


<div>
<div> [<span style="text-decoration:underline">Deleted. The student provided too much details that we want you to figure out by yourself.</span>]</div>
<div>3. Don't worry, we're all new to this. The difference is that the second one can handle times when other functions specify that the matrix will be constant. The first one has the ability to change the matrix, and the second one doesn't, but the implementation is exactly the same. [<span style="text-decoration:underline">Think about why their implementations should be the same</span>]</div>
</div>


<p></p>


<p></p>


<p>Edit: Oops! I didn't mean to provide too much info, I'll be more careful in the future. Anyways, instructor is right about 1, I just didn't realize it, it should just be pointer arithmetic, anything more than that is just redundant code.</p>

-------------------------------------------------
<p>1. From the RME of the function, "mat points to a valid Matrix", "Returns a pointer to the element in the Matrix at the given row and column". So max is given (data type: Matrix *), but what you want to return is a pointer that points to an element in the Matrix (data type: int *).</p>


<p>2. I recommend checking lab 3 again. Remember the elements of an array are stored contiguously in memory. In other words, they are next to each other. So if a pointer points to the first element, what is the thing that the pointer (pointer+1) points to? You may do the math and find the pointer that points to the wanted element.</p>


<p>3. Here is a <a href="https://eecs280staff.github.io/notes/06_Compound_Objects.html#the-const-keyword" rel="noreferrer" target="_blank">link</a> to the note of EECS 280 which explains what const is.</p>


<p></p>


<p>Pointers are definitely difficult (and important). Project 2 is designed to give you a better idea of what are pointers, and how they work, so don't worry too much if you get confused at first sight.</p>

Error in tests

<p>Can I have help with the following error. I am working with the function: find_minimal_cost_seam(). It seems to not run because of an out of bounds error. I'm also confused a bit by the spec. Is the seam at a certain row equal to the minimum of the three pixels above or below it?</p>


<p></p>


<p>Thanks</p>

-------------------------------------------------
<div class="markdown" id="q38kRj58oo0ooY"><p>So for find_minimal_vertical_seam you’re working from bottom of the matrix to the top. Seam is an array, so each item in seam corresponds to the minimum cost pixel for that row.</p>
<p>To find the minimum cost pixel at any row <code>i</code>, you choose the minimum index of the 3 values in the row above it, as shown in the diagram. It’s easy to get out of bounds errors here since at each end of the matrix, there will only be 2 values to choose from. You should also consider that there is no row <strong>above</strong> row 0.

matrix init help
<p>hi, how should we go about initializing the matrix? i'm a bit confused on how we're supposed to do it</p>

-------------------------------------------------
<p>Don't worry it's easy. Just copy the assertions to start, and then set the width and height. That's it. Doing this is not so bad, for instance, this is how you set the width:</p>


<p>mat-&gt;width = width;</p>


<p>Because mat is a pointer to a matrix type variable, it needs the -&gt; to set the width attribute of the struct (instead of the dot, as usual, like mat.width wouldn't work here), and then it uses "width" on the left as the keyword.</p>


<p></p>


<p>Edit: I deleted the example the student listed earlier. It was not wrong, but I don't think it really relates to how you want to handle a pointer or set some attributes of an instance of a struct. It might make things more difficult to understand.</p>


<p></p>


<p>Edit: I should have gone about that differently, I only meant to say that mat-&gt;width=width; is very confusing, and we must do that because the matrix struct has width as one of its attributes:</p>


<p><img alt="image.png" height="73" src="/redirect/s3?bucket=uploads&amp;prefix=paste%2Fkw74v59av4w2bg%2F7c3f0c26b6051c9b4bad132ab1334c347983b2907e86739ae9cf856cfcd5d0f4%2Fimage.png" width="321"/></p>


<p>And we were provided with code that had declaration lines like this:</p>


<p><img alt="image.png" height="16" src="/redirect/s3?bucket=uploads&amp;prefix=paste%2Fkw74v59av4w2bg%2F75baafa929f0a24012721d8860f1012ab4d9cb326178781f160de56e2244cc4c%2Fimage.png" width="275"/></p>

<p>One is for changing the matrix, the other is for accessing the matrix and it has compatibility with function calls that pass in a constant matrix. It's good practice because it will help prevent us from changing a matrix when we don't want to.</p>

Tips for Test Cases
<p>I've been struggling to expose the bugs for Matrix.cpp and Image.cpp. Is there specific functions where the bugs are, or specific cases I should think about? </p>

-------------------------------------------------
<p>When I think about test cases, I think about what could break my implementation. Typically any function that has a loop of some sort (while, for) are broken by out of bounds errors. Look at how you implemented your functions and think about what out of bounds errors could occur. Also think about size of the data. Will a larger number or a larger amount of data impact the results? </p>

Confusion with seam_carve_width() function
<p>I am a bit confused on the implementation of the seam_carve_width() function. I followed the exact steps from the spec, but I'm in sort of an awkward position where I'm creating a seam array, then have to pass it to the remove_vertical_seam() function that takes a CONST seam array. Is my implementation completely wrong or am I missing something?</p>


<p><img alt="Screen_Shot_2022-09-21_at_9.42.47_PM.pngNaN" height="147" src="/redirect/s3?bucket=uploads&amp;prefix=paste%2Fl7i20wztokn2or%2F1dcc1b33e72af88dab4a715647608c3071cde2e767ff35c8c07f911ead7a3faf%2FScreen_Shot_2022-09-21_at_9.42.47_PM.png" width="356"/></p>


<p></p>

-------------------------------------------------
<p>Edit: That is because you cannot initialize the array as something that could change each time you run it. Instead, initialize it with the maximum matrix height, as is done in several of the test files.</p>

-------------------------------------------------
<p>Oh shoot I meant to send it to instructors only. How can I delete it?</p>

-------------------------------------------------
<p>Here I'll delete it for you :) -- nvm looks like you got it</p>

-------------------------------------------------
<p>All good now, only a handful of people saw that, and plus its not a big deal (people do it on accident all the time). I haven't ever done a private post but I'm sure you'll find it.</p>

-------------------------------------------------
<p>So just wondering, does this mean we can violate the requires clause of remove vertical seam?</p>


<p><img alt="image.png" height="82" src="/redirect/s3?bucket=uploads&amp;prefix=paste%2Fkzhw6s5i2wb5qp%2Fc54b6e91d4089410c284cf55644ba0a2cbba5e862edfb1e08e5d6e1fb5ece4b2%2Fimage.png" width="600"/></p>


<p></p>

-------------------------------------------------
<p>Not really. Since you need to create an array with a defined size, you have to initialize it to the max matrix width because it is const and doesn't change. However, in your implementation you should only fill in the array up to the width. So if the width was 5, you fill in 5 of the array elements. That's why the requires clause says the size of the seam rather than the size of the array of the seam.</p>


<p></p>


<p>Hope this helps!</p>

<p>Image_public_test.exe: Matrix.cpp:79: int* Matrix_at(Matrix*, int, int): Assertion `0 &lt;= row &amp;&amp; row &lt; mat-&gt;height' failed.<br/>Aborted</p>


<p></p>


<p>I do not know how my row and cols got messed up, but any type of help would be appreciated.</p>

-------------------------------------------------
<p>You should use the debugger to find where the error starts. There’s a million places it could be, but fortunately, the debugger will let you find it. If you don’t know how to use it yet, right now is the best time to learn!! One second I’ll find the link for it:</p>


<p></p>


<p>Edit: So here's the link for the vscode debugging method:</p>

<p></p>


<p>Weirdly the debugging setup is in the run section, but once you finish setting up, if you go to debug, it will show you how to use it (assuming you don't already know how).</p>

-------------------------------------------------
<p>it means that somewhere in your image.cpp you're indexing out of bounds in your matrix (i.e. row is less than 0 or greater than height). would recommend stepping through your code to find exactly where as the student suggested!</p>

-------------------------------------------------
<p>Thanks for all the help! I figured out my issue was that I wasn't initializing the 3 different matrices in one of the init functions.</p>

address error when using debugger
<p>Hi,</p>


<p></p>


<p>I was trying to run my debugger. The directory it shows is correct, however, it is saying that no file exists. Any idea why it is saying the file doesn't exist?</p>

-------------------------------------------------
Precisely which file is it saying it can’t find? Did you specify which file it needs to use in the launch.json? If so, did you actually make that executable yet?

-------------------------------------------------
<p>Did you run "make _____.exe"? This creates the executable file, so if you haven't run the command then the file wouldn't exist.</p>

address sanitizer error. having trouble interpreting and tracing back the error
<p>Hi,</p>


<p></p>


<p>I've written and tested Matrix and Image pretty well. I wrote processing.cpp today and tried running the public processing tests. This is the error I got. I traced it back to the line in processing.cpp where the error is caused but cannot understand the "freed by thread to here" and "allocated to here" parts of the error message. Could you please help me trace it back?<img alt="" height="1594" src="/redirect/s3?bucket=uploads&amp;prefix=paste%2Fl7amnx6s8wg5z4%2F2cab44625b08ec2b023c4fdce7d587b3a2b1b78150e2b5fe2c1ea9d8255c0e7a%2FScreen_Shot_2022-09-21_at_11.10.41_PM.png" width="2451"/> </p>

-------------------------------------------------
<p>this is telling you you're doing a read from undefined memory. I'd suggest using your debugger and stepping through the "dog remove seam" tests and stepping into your functions in order to see where the error is being thrown. the lines under the "read of size 4" part (e.g. image.cpp 66, processing_public_tests.cpp 246) should give you hints about where to check as well.</p>


<p></p>


<p>the allocated/freed is telling you that you where you allocated the memory, and where it became undefined (free)</p>

<p>As far as I'm aware the files should be able to compile properly, just fail at the asserts. I'm using WSL if it makes a difference. Every other file will make and run properly.  Is this an issue with the makefile？</p>


<p></p>


<p></p>

-------------------------------------------------
Did you make a processing.cpp file? Is there one in your current directory?

-------------------------------------------------
<p>Resolved in follow-ups.</p>

-------------------------------------------------
<p>There is a processing.cpp file. Every function in it is stubbed. </p>

-------------------------------------------------
My partner set up the project for us, so I’m not super sure about this, but doesn’t it have .starter at the end? If so remove that.
<p></p>
<div>Also remove that from processing.h if it has it.</div>

-------------------------------------------------
<p>Nope, I removed all the .starters. </p>

-------------------------------------------------
Can you send a screenshot of your directory? In your file explorer or whatever is fine

-------------------------------------------------
<p>Nevermind, I figured it out lol. Somehow my processing.cpp file got named to processsing.cpp. Hard to notice but definitely an issue. Thanks for the help though!</p>

<p>Glad you found it!</p>

Confused about Matrix_fill
<p>So  for the Matrix fill function , are we supposed to be filling values at the pointer proved for our mat. I am confused about where we get those values from , is that the ppm file? In general for when I am just writing the function should I just be using a ifstream to stream values into my function to fill in an array at the pointer of mat , so that I can actually start using the other matrix functions ?</p>

-------------------------------------------------
No in matrix fill you just fill a provided matrix with all the same value (that is also provided). It is just matrix stuff, it has nothing to do with any external files (no use of any streams or any .ppm). You just iterate through a matrix and set each entry to “value”.

-------------------------------------------------
<p>Ohhhhh so in the spec when they say "none of these function using nested loop" they just mean column, row, and width function don't need for loop but others actually need....</p>

-------------------------------------------------
Yeah! :)

-------------------------------------------------
<p>But why do we need another function specially for the border values though??? this confuses me a lot, I think i can implenmenting the matrix_fill by go through the whole 1d matirx( #of elements calculated with the width and height of the 2d matrix) , why do we need to treat the border elements differently?</p>

-------------------------------------------------
Oh it’s not that you need a special function for them, it’s that sometimes the user might want to *just* fill the border values, or in fact, you will want to just fill the border values when writing image.cpp

-------------------------------------------------
<p>Thanks a lot!!! And also,  when they say"border", there are four borders right...they are the first row, the last row, the first column, the last column?</p>

-------------------------------------------------
That’s right!

-------------------------------------------------
<p>Make sure you have dog.ppm in your current directory, the code to open it is not very complicated (I've included it so that you can see it), so I wouldn't expect that to be the issue (this code is just from the processing_public_tests.cpp file):</p>

<p>Can't post that here, though I suggest you make a private post because that is weird.</p>

<p>Hmm, that is strange. Could you try stepping through Matrix_row with a debugger, and sharing a screenshot of your variable values please?

running matrix_tests.cpp without running image tests
<p>Hi, I'm trying to run my matrix.cpp functions through the Matrix_tests.cpp and I have a few test cases but when I run the program on Xcode, it doesn't test those test cases it just goes all the way to the Image_test.cpp and is giving me a assertion failed because I haven't started implementing those functions.</p>

-------------------------------------------------
<p>try:</p>


<p>make Matrix_public_test.exe</p>

<p></p>


<p>and</p>


<p>make Matrix_tests.exe</p>

<p>Pictured to the right is the correct dog output after remove seam from the starter files.

<p>It looks like the first 3 pixels in the first row are incorrect as well as some in the preceding rows. I would suggest using your visual debugger to find the step where these become incorrect. For further help, try heading to office hours! </p>

How to compute "energy" in processing.cpp
<p>So for the function "computer_energy_matrix" in processing.cpp, we need to "Compute the energy for each non-border pixel" <img src="https://eecs280staff.github.io/p2-cv/images/energy_matrix.svg"/></p>


<p>I can see that for this particular 5x5 image, the energies are the following values. However, how do I find the energies of a fresh image that currently has an empty energy matrix? </p>

-------------------------------------------------
<div class="markdown" id="q38kRj58oo0ooY"><p>As per the spec:</p>
<p>To construct the energy Matrix for the whole image, your function should do the following:</p>
<ol><li>Initialize the energy Matrix with the same size as the Image and fill it with zeros.</li><li>Compute the energy for each non-border pixel, using the formula above.</li><li>Find the maximum energy so far, and use it to fill in the border pixels</li></ol>
<p>So first you initialize the energy matrix and fill it with zeros. Then use this formula to compute the energy for each entry in the matrix:
<code>energy(X) = squared_difference(N, S) + squared_difference(W, E)</code></p></div>

<p>Hello, when I try to run processing these errors prevent anything from being compiled and unsure where they are coming from. None of these functions are being written in processing.cpp explicitly as well. </p>


<p>Any help is super appreciated! </p>

-------------------------------------------------
<p>Are you building/running from XCode? If so, you might find Sam's follow-up comment in <a data-pats="post_ref" href="808" onclick="return PE.gotoPost('808');">@808</a> useful. It's possible your compile sources in your XCode configuration are missing some P2 .cpp files. Following the guide <a href="https://eecs280staff.github.io/p1-stats/setup_xcode.html#compile-with-xcode" rel="noreferrer" target="_blank">here</a>, check that they include all of the .cpp files you implemented (Matrix.cpp, Image.cpp, etc).</p>


<p>If this doesn't work, I would try manually compiling your project from the terminal by running "make resize.cpp" and see if you still get these errors. If you do, you might have include issues, and we can go from there.</p>

-------------------------------------------------
<p>Thank you for letting me know! </p>


<p>I double checked the compile sources and the Matrix.cpp and Image.cpp are also included. I also tried running it through terminal but it also gave me an error. </p>

-------------------------------------------------
<p>Ah, I see those undefined functions are from Matrix_test_helpers.h and Image_test_helpers.h. Are you only using these functions in Image_tests.cpp and Matrix_tests.cpp? And if so, are you including the .h files, and when you compile your tests, are you including those helper cpp files?</p>

<p>If you have not already, I believe you have to initialize the rgb channel matrices in the first Image_init function in image.cpp, not just the second Image_init. I only initialized them in the second and I kept getting this error because the red channel had a width and height of like -1000000000 and goes out of bounds when you call Matrix_at in your Image_set_pixel function, and again when you call Image_set_pixel in your Image_fill function.</p>

-------------------------------------------------
<p>This is the Sanitzer's way of telling you that you are running into a segmentation fault. In other words, somewhere in the execution of your program you are attempting to access something at an address you shouldn't (likely an invalid index into a matrix). Thankfully this output does give you some hints for where to look for this error: try looking around Image.cpp line 93 and Image.cpp line 116 and see if anything catches your eye.</p>

Multiple assert functions in one test function
<p>If I have multiple assert statements in one TEST() function, will it run through all of them, or just the first one? If so, if it says "PASS" does that indicate that every assert function passed the test?</p>

-------------------------------------------------
It will run through all of them, just like it does in the public test case that we all have. When it says pass, that means it got through all of them.

What does "Check respecting Matrix and Image interfaces" on autograder mean?
<p>Hi, just a quick question what </p>


<p>" Check respecting Matrix and Image interfaces in processing.cpp" and similar phrases on autograder really mean. </p>


<p>Would love an explanation on this and how we should implement this?</p>


<p></p>


<p>Thanks!</p>

-------------------------------------------------
It means that you don’t do stuff like mat->data in Image.cpp.
<div><br/></div>
<div>It is talking about the “interface”, which is the term used to describe the abstraction of the matrix module, and any module, for that matter.</div>

-------------------------------------------------
<p>To add onto the student's answer, there is more detail about what <a href="https://eecs280staff.github.io/p2-cv/#respect-the-interfaces" rel="noreferrer" target="_blank">respecting the interfaces</a> should look like in project 2 on the spec. Essentially, you should only be directly accessing member variables of the Image struct within your implementation of Image itself, and same for Matrix, etc. On the outside, you should be making use of the getter functions you write such as <kbd>Matrix_width</kbd> instead of trying to do <kbd>mat-&gt;width</kbd> directly.</p>

the load_image() function in text case is using my Image_init that does not involve istream
<p>When the test functions for processing are running, the load_image() function is using my Image_init that does not involve istream, so it is crashing because it is asserting false that the image width &gt; 0. I am confused how this is possible because its parameter is an istream. </p>

-------------------------------------------------
<p>did you ever figure this out. I am having the same issue.</p>


<p></p>

-------------------------------------------------
<p>Make sure that your function definitions/headers (not implementations) for the two overloaded versions of <kbd>Image_init</kbd> are identical other than the number and type of parameters. Without being able to see exactly what is going on, it is a little bit hard to tell what the issue is, so I would recommend perhaps making a private Piazza post with a screenshot of what's happening when your tests run or feel free to come to office hours :)</p>

Image_fill BAD ACCESS

<p>When trying to run the public test for image, it keeps running into this error at Image_fill when I debug it. Is there a different way to set each pixel to a certain color, or could someone possibly point me in the right direction? I currently have it so I dereference the matrix_at function for each color channel and then set it equal to the color that has been passed through using the dot operator. </p>

-------------------------------------------------
<p>That process sounds right, it could be an issue with what you are doing for for `Matrix_at` function. Make sure when you are trying to find the element at the row and column necessary, you aren't attempting some access beyond the size of the matrix's data array. (either a negative index or the max size and beyond index) I also see that the undefined behavior sanitizer said the error was in `Matrix.cpp`, something you will want to check.</p>

Error with const matrix_at
<p>I keep getting the error "Cannot initialize a variable of type 'const int *' with an rvalue of type 'long'" when attempting to assign the pointer in the const Matrix_at. What does type 'long' indicate, and how would I go about fixing this?</p>

-------------------------------------------------
<div class="markdown" id="q38kRj58oo0ooY"><p><code>long</code> is another type of number (like <code>int</code>, <code>short</code>, <code>double</code>, etc.). I’ve seen this a couple of times with students doing pointer arithmetic - this is probably something with your hardware and not because of anything you’re doing incorrectly. What I’ve told students is just do</p>
<p><code>(int)(&lt;your expression that evaluates to a long&gt;)</code></p>
<p>and that should be fine.</p>
<p>In your case I would also say: doing that by itself won’t make your type compatible with <code>const int *</code> because <code>int</code> is not the same as <code>int *</code>. (Depending on what exactly you’re doing the <code>const</code> part should handle itself?)</p></div>

Cost Matrix Error and Debugger
<p>I've been working on the processing.cpp files and when I tried to run the public tests after I completed them, I got an assert error with the cost matrix function. What is the best strategy to resolve this? Also, I've never really used a debugger before, so how specifically could I use my debugger to resolve this issue?</p>


<p></p>


<p><img alt="Screen_Shot_2022-09-22_at_5.02.28_PM.pngNaN" height="126" src="/redirect/s3?bucket=uploads&amp;prefix=paste%2Fl7i20wztokn2or%2Fb311a6b9cfe359227e87b59864d85d46e2a98775a8b1475060da677f0e93175e%2FScreen_Shot_2022-09-22_at_5.02.28_PM.png" width="282"/></p>

-------------------------------------------------
<p>It looks like there's something wrong with your cost function. I'd suggest taking a closer look at your code and the spec. It would also be a good idea to step through your function and tests. Which IDE are you using? I will link a debugging tutorial for the respective IDE.</p>

-------------------------------------------------
<p>You may change partners between projects. You may not change partners during a project. In exceptional cases, you may request partnership dissolution via email to the faculty. If the dissolution is granted, both partners may use previously shared code and both partners must work alone on the remainder of the project.</p>

compute energy edge cases
<p>How should we compute the energy of a matrix that is only made of borders. For example if a 2x2 matrix is passed in, wouldn't you not be able to calculate the energy because there is no N,S,E,W and only border pixels. </p>

-------------------------------------------------
<p>My fault, I was thinking of vertical cost_matrix. </p>

-------------------------------------------------
<div class="markdown" id="q38kRj58oo1ooY"><p>Per the student followup, a correct 2x2 matrix will consist of only border pixels, which per the specifications for <code>compute_energy_matrix</code> should be left as 0 (because that would be the maximum energy found after computing the energy for each non-border pixel).</p></div>

-------------------------------------------------
Also wondering about this, feels like it shouldn’t be something that we have to consider practically speaking, really that would be like infinite energy. Hoping to get instructor feedback on this in case they are testing this privately.

-------------------------------------------------
<div class="markdown" id="q38kRj58oo0ooY"><p>See answers.</p></div>

-------------------------------------------------
You need to fill the matrix with 0 first. In that sense, if it’s 2 x 2, it will just be zero.

pointers to an array
<p>Hi, I am confused about the pointers to an array. For instance,</p>


<p>int arr[5] = {1,2,3,4,5};</p>


<p>int *ptr = arr;</p>


<p>Will it be a pointer to a pointer, because array is considered as pointer? Also, does the pointer points to a single pointer or a set of pointers? How can I access elements of ptr? Can I use *ptr[0]? I am confused about ptr[0] because I thought that is an expression for arrays. Why pointer can do the same thing? Are arrays the exact same thing as pointers? What is the difference between ptr[0] and *ptr[0]? Is *ptr[I] = arr[I]?  Sorry, I am totally confused with this. </p>


<p></p>


<p>Many thanks!</p>


<p> </p>

-------------------------------------------------
<div class="markdown" id="q38kRj58oo0ooY"><p>Yeah <code>arr</code> in this case decays to an <code>int *</code>, so you can think of it as the same data type as an int pointer. So setting <code>int *ptr = arr;</code> makes ptr point to the same thing as <code>arr</code>.</p>
<p><code>arr[0] = ptr[0]</code>, and you can also do <code>ptr[1], ptr[2], ...</code> assuming there’s space in the array.  Also, printing <code>ptr</code> will have the same output as printing <code>arr</code> since they’re pointing to the same thing!</p>
<p><code>*ptr[0]</code> will likely crash since you’re dereferencing an integer. Does this help?</p></div>

<p>Thank you so much! That really helps me!</p>

Matrix_column_of_min_value_in_row question
<p>For Matrix_column_of_min_value_in_row, is the starting value (column_start) always going to be zero, or is it supposed to pick any part of a row (ex: from index 3 to 6)?</p>

-------------------------------------------------
It could be between 0 and column_end (exclusive)

-------------------------------------------------
<p>the variables you pass in tell it which columns to look between: [column start, column end) inclusive on start and exclusive on end</p>

-------------------------------------------------
<p>But it doesn't necessarily start at 0, correct? It <em>could</em> start at index 3, for example, right?</p>

Is version control needed if we don't have a partner?

-------------------------------------------------
<p>I believe you technically do not need version control, even if you have a partner. It is only there to make it easier for yourself or partner to back up your project and see all previous versions of it. It is still good practice to use since you will use it at software companies. </p>

special rules for c-string and cout

<p>cout's special behavior only applies to char[] and *char.</p>

<p>cout &lt;&lt; char[] <em> &lt;- will output the c-string.</em></p>


<p>cout &lt;&lt; *char <em>&lt;- will output the c-string it is pointing to</em></p>


<p>cout &lt;&lt; *char[] <em>&lt;- will output the address of the memory location of the first string.</em></p>

Memory Leak

<ol start="2"><li>on line 90, you are comparing to the address of the variable declared on line 78. This is not consistent.

<p><s>Still looking into the memory leak.</s></p>
<p>Think I found the reason for the memory leaks - your tests fail before you <code>delete mat</code>, so that part of the code is never reached and your memory leaks. When I try them out and change the tests so that they pass, I don’t get the leaks. I think what you could do is create a matrix locally (without using <code>new</code>) and pass in the address of that matrix using the <code>&amp;</code> operator.</p></div>

const Matrix_at
<p>I seem to be having a lot of trouble with const Matrix_at. I have been trying to initially create a pointer and initialize it to mat-&gt;data. However, it only allows this to work if the pointer is a const. How would I then change this pointer later on using pointer arithmetic if it is a const? I've tried declaring the pointer and doing the pointer arithmetic all in one but then I get a warning indicating that the data types are different, even though I'm using all const pointers in the arithmetic. Is there something I'm missing that would make this easier?</p>

-------------------------------------------------
<div class="markdown" id="q38kRj58oo0ooY"><p>I don’t think you actually need to return a <code>const int*</code> in the <code>const</code> version of <code>Matrix_at</code>. The computer will automatically make the conversion from <code>int*</code> to <code>const int*</code> since it’s an increase in security. Try writing the same definition as your non-const <code>Matrix_at</code>. As long as you aren’t modifying the Matrix itself (which you shouldn’t be), you shouldn’t have any issues.</p></div>

-------------------------------------------------
<p>As the student suggests, if you are just returning an address of your mat-&gt;data array, the compiler will automatically convert this to a const int pointer. If you are directly returning a mat-&gt;data element in your non-const Matrix_at, you will be able to copy the implementation. If you are saving off your pointer and returning a local variable, make sure that local variable that you are returning is a const int *.</p>

Calling Matrix_at in other Matrix.cpp functions
<p>When I try to call Matrix_at in other Matrix.cpp functions, like Matrix_column_of_min_value_in_row it is automatically calling the const Matrix_at function, which then is causing XCode to give me a bunch of errors. How do I get it so it calls the first Matrix_at function, so I can use it to initialize variables of type int without XCode giving me an error?</p>


<p></p>


<p>Edit: It may not actually be calling the const version, but it is giving me errors like "Cannot initialize a variable of type 'int' with an rvalue of type 'const int *'" and "Comparison between pointer and integer ('const int *' and 'int')"</p>


<p></p>


<p>Another edit: I think I figured it out! I was trying to assign the address itself to an int variable, rather than the value of the element that the pointer was pointing to. Had to dereference it using *. Haven't tested it yet but the errors went away!</p>

-------------------------------------------------
<div class="markdown" id="q38kRj58oo0ooY"><p>Yep, Matrix_at is supposed to return the pointer so you can either read or write to the value in the matrix.</p></div>

Getting a SIGABRT Warning
<p>I'm getting SIGABRT when I'm running my debugger for the cost matrix function for the crabster.ppm file. I passed all the tests for dog.ppm, does anyone know why it isn't working for crabster.ppm? (ss is from public test file) Anyone know what SIGABRT is too?<img alt="Screen_Shot_2022-09-22_at_10.21.43_PM.pngNaN" height="191" src="/redirect/s3?bucket=uploads&amp;prefix=paste%2Fl7i20wztokn2or%2F44360747cb2e28822ab8f3b8b3efe3f23a8e364cbe8d5158958f8f169e0f979d%2FScreen_Shot_2022-09-22_at_10.21.43_PM.png" width="1079"/></p>

-------------------------------------------------
<p>SIGABRT in this instance means that the assert statement failed. Since assert's goal is effectively to say "This statement <em>must</em> be true", it will stop the program if it isn't. When the statement is false, assert will send a <em><strong>sig</strong></em>nal to <em><strong>ab</strong></em>o<em><strong>rt</strong></em> the program's execution.</p>


<p></p>


<p>It's effectively telling you that the two matrices are not equal, in this instance.</p>

-------------------------------------------------
<p>SIGABRT while debugging for line 150 in your code is most likely just caused by your assertion failing.  I would compare your cost_mat with cost_mat_correct to see why those two matrices are different if this error is caused by the assertion failing.</p>

<p>I just realized data gets stored in a 1D array lol nvmid so when i assign to interface do i just assign value to all elements of data?</p>


<p></p>


<p></p>


<p><b>void</b> Matrix_fill(Matrix* mat, <b>int</b> value) {</p>


<p>    <b>for</b>(<b>int</b> i = 0; i &lt; mat-&gt;width; i++) {</p>


<p>        <b>for</b> (<b>int</b> j; j &lt; mat-&gt;height; j++) {</p>


<p>            mat[i][j] = value;</p>


<p>        }</p>


<p>    }</p>


<p>    </p>


<p>}</p>

-------------------------------------------------
<p>Important thing here is that mat is a pointer to a Matrix object. A matrix object has 3 attributes: width, height, and data. Therefore you need to specify which attribute of your Matrix you're trying to alter. For example, if you want to modify data you would want to do something like (*mat).data or mat-&gt;data to get to your data array. </p>


<p></p>


<p>Since data is a 1D array, you can then loop through and set every element in data. </p>

interface
<p>What does interface mean? What's the definition for it? Thanks!</p>

-------------------------------------------------
<div class="markdown" id="q38kRj58oo0ooY"><p>An interface is a way of interacting with a system or object. In the case of this project, the interface is the methods provided in the header files to read or modify parts of the structs. For example, we can read a value in <code>Matrix</code> by using <code>Matrix_at()</code>.</p>
<p>When the spec tells you to “respect the interface”, they want you to only use these functions to read and write to the objects. This means that you would use <code>Matrix_at</code> whenever you want to access a specific value instead of trying to do something like <code>mat-&gt;data[y][x]</code>. This can help if you ever need to change the way the interface works, since you’ll only need to change one place in your codebase.</p></div>

Matrix not deleting
<p>While making test cases for my matrix, I realized that even after I deleted the matrix I used from a previous test through "delete mat;", when I initialized a new matrix on a different test without setting its starting values, I got random values which seemed to have bled over from the original matrix's remains in the memory. I could just fill it up using Matrix_fill() right after it's initialized, but is this expected behavior?</p>

-------------------------------------------------
<div class="markdown" id="q38kRj58oo0ooY"><p>In computer memory, deleting something doesn’t usually wipe its bits. It just tells whatever’s running the gears that the space that used to be occupied is now available. You can tell from lobster that unitialized variables/memory aren’t all set to 0, they’re just at what arbitrary value they were at before. This is also why experts can sometimes recover files that have been deleted permanently on a system.
At least this is my theory - I wouldn’t know if C++ ran in a different way.</p></div>

-------------------------------------------------
When you create the new matrix, until you fill it with specific values, it'll put random values inside there. In this case, the values matched your previous Matrix, but this is random and will not always be the case!

-------------------------------------------------

unfilled matrix
<p>if you create a matrix with 2 rows and 2 columns, do you have to fill the spots with actual numbers for it to be considered a valid matrix?</p>

-------------------------------------------------
<div class="markdown" id="q38kRj58oo0ooY"><p>I don’t know that you have to fill the values in the Matrix with numerical values, but there isn’t much of a good reason for not filling the matrix with values. In the best case scenario, you can run your functions without an exception being thrown, but they might give you logical bugs like the max function outputting a number higher than any other number you used. In the worst case (and most likely), the compiler or runtime will give you an error when trying to run a function with that Matrix.</p></div>

Significance of std::endl stream flush vs '\n'?
<p>I know that when you insert std::endl in a stream, it "flushes" the stream. Is this fact relevant to us when working with various types of streams for P2?<br/>Is only using newline characters (for Matrix_print() output for example) going to cause any memory issues? Just curious. Thanks!</p>

-------------------------------------------------
<p>Using either should not make a difference.</p>

strcpy in lecture 6
<p>After the function call, do we have word2 = frog/0d, not frog/0 since it stops substitute characters after the 4th operation. And when we cout array of chars, it stops when it reads an escape sequence?</p>

-------------------------------------------------
<p>Yes, word2 would equal "frog\0d" for the reason you listed. And yes, generally when functions operate on C-strings, they will continue to process the C-string until they reach the null character (unless a size is passed in). So when you print word2 using cout, "frog" will be displayed since it stops printing the string after it reaches the null character.</p>

type matrix
<p>in p2 overview, why does it uses -&gt; after the name of matrix(mat) instead of using "." ? Isn't "mat" the name of the matrix struct but not a pointer that point to mat?</p>

-------------------------------------------------
<p>They both do the same</p>


<p></p>


<p>Answer below taken from <a data-pats="post_ref" href="696" onclick="return PE.gotoPost('696');">@696</a>:</p>


<p></p>


<p>(*mat).data</p>


<p>This one first dereferences mat (see *mat), which you can now treat like a struct. You use the dot operator "." to access its members - in this example I used data (.data) .</p>


<p></p>


<p>mat-&gt;data</p>


<p>does the exact same thing as above, but substituting the * and . operators for the arrow operator "-&gt;" this dereferences mat and accesses a member.</p>

-------------------------------------------------
<p>I understand that . and -&gt; do the same thing. I think we use . after the struct name and -&gt; after a pointer point to that. Here (*mat) means to dereference mat, so mat should be a pointer, but isn't mat the name of the object in struct? Is it like it decay to the address of the beginning of the struct like array? If it decays when we call it, how can we use p.(name) in the lecture slides?</p>

-------------------------------------------------
<p>"but isn't mat the name of the object in struct?"</p>


<p>- No, mat is the name of the pointer to the object. We might not know what the name of the object/matrix is, and that's fine, we can still access the object/matrix through the pointer</p>

-------------------------------------------------

------------------------@887-------------------------
matrix_init
<p>1. After declare the array a[][], should I let mat point to a instead of point to mat?</p>


<p>2. Do I got empty matrix from this function or a matrix filled with data from mat? Do I fill with data in mat row by row?</p>


<p>3. I use mat = a; I think it's assign mat point to the first element in a, why it doesn't work?</p>


<p>4. I define a pointer point to a, but I can't let mat point to that pointer neither. there's an error when mat=ptr(array), what is the type of mat? I can't neither assign int* and int**</p>

-------------------------------------------------
<p>If you are talking about the matrix_init function in matrix.ccp, all you have to do is access the members of the mat struct and change them to the width and height you are passing into the function. </p>


<p></p>


<p>If you look at matrix.h file, you will see the matrix struct and its members. Your matrix_init function is passing in a matrix struct called mat. To access its members you do the following:</p>


<p>"matrix struct name"-&gt;"member name" </p>


<p></p>


<p>Then you can set the corresponding struct members to the width and height you are passing in.</p>

------------------------@888-------------------------
Image_set_pixel
<p>I'm confused on how set_pixel is supposed to work. The RME says it modifies *img and sets the pixel in the Image at the given row and column to a given color. </p>


<p></p>


<p>To do this I used Matrix_at to access the red/green/and blue channels of *img and set those each equal to the r, g,b values provided by Pixel color. However, my tests say this:<img alt="Screen_Shot_2022-09-23_at_9.19.22_AM.pngNaN" src="/redirect/s3?bucket=uploads&amp;prefix=paste%2Fky330it8gsm70t%2F4db5e26e34b16c8a0cc138f809ae2eaac2fed35464c69687312e6fb8501dcf95%2FScreen_Shot_2022-09-23_at_9.19.22_AM.png"/></p>


<p></p>


<p></p>

-------------------------------------------------
<p>Your approach sounds good. "SEGV" indicates you are trying to access memory that you're not allowed to acccess (typically memory that hasn;t been assigned a value). Based on your most recent autograder submission, I'd suggest checking how you assign the r,g,b values to their respective channels and use your debugger to see where the error occurs.</p>

image->width
<p>Just a quick question, the function image_width appears below the function image_print, and we're supposed to get the width of the image in image_print, but I remember not being able to directly get the width because it was bad practice.. should I change the order of the functions and try to use the width function at all times?</p>

-------------------------------------------------
<p>It's ok to directly access an Image's width in Image.cpp since we are still within the Image module. The getter for Image should be utilized in non-Image files to respect the interface. See <a href="https://eecs280staff.github.io/p2-cv/#respect-the-interfaces" rel="noreferrer" target="_blank">this section</a> of the spec for more explanation.</p>

-------------------------------------------------

------------------------@890-------------------------
do we need to use atoi in image_init with the istream

-------------------------------------------------
<p>No</p>

-------------------------------------------------
<p>so the numbers are already integers?</p>

-------------------------------------------------
<p>You will have to read them as integers.</p>

-------------------------------------------------

------------------------@891-------------------------
what do we do about the whitespace character in image_init

-------------------------------------------------
<p>the stream we are passing into image_init() doesn't read whitespace, so you can basically ignore the whitespace character</p>

-------------------------------------------------
<p>will it read onto the next lime or should we put is &gt;&gt; endl?</p>

-------------------------------------------------
<p>By default, the stream will skip any whitespace character (so any tab, space, or newline character) to get to the next value of the requested type. So you shouldn't need to do anything special.</p>

<div></div>
</div>

-------------------------------------------------
<p>I'm not sure I understand your question. For this function, mat is a pointer-to-const. This means we're not allowed to change any values of the matrix object that mat points at. You want to consider how you can use pointer arithmetic to get to the correct element in data. </p>

Remove_vertical_seam()
<p>How are we supposed to change img's width value in remove_vertical_seam()?</p>


<p></p>


<p>I followed the instructions, copying everything but the seam of img into a smaller image and then copying the smaller image's contents back into the original image, but when I run processing_public_tests(), it detects that the widths don't match and fails despite the rest of the images being identical. </p>


<p></p>


<p>When I directly decrement img's width (which I know doesn't respect the interfaces), the function works. Is there another way to do this? The project description seemed to forbid changing the width all together, so I am unsure of what to do.</p>


<p></p>


<p>Thank you.</p>


<p></p>

-------------------------------------------------
<p>The smaller image that you create has the correct width and height, instead of copying everything back into the original image, is it possible to somehow set the original image to be the newer smaller image? Consider that you are given a pointer to the original image.</p>

-------------------------------------------------

------------------------@894-------------------------
Seam Size
<p>In the find_minimal_vertical_seam function one of the requires statements says "the size of seam is &gt;= Matrix_height(cost)." Is there a way to assert this? I am not sure how to get the length/size of the seam. I tried "seam.size()" but this does not work since seam is of type int*. </p>

-------------------------------------------------
<p>Since seam is a normal array and not a vector, we don't know its size unless it's explicitly passed into the function as a separate parameter, unfortunately. So while you cannot assert this requirement in find_minimal_vertical_seam(), you can make some logical guarantee in the caller function. That is, since you're writing the caller function, you can make sure to initialize seam to be sufficiently large before passing it in. Hope this helps!</p>

-------------------------------------------------
How to find the size of an array

<p>I'm trying to assert that the size of seam[] is at least as big as the height of a cost matrix in find_minimal_vertical_seam. Is this necessary? If so, could someone provide an example of how I could find the size of my array? I'm pretty new to C++ and array functions.</p>


<p></p>


<p>Thank u!</p>

-------------------------------------------------
<p>This is not necessary! Arrays do not know their own size so you can assume the size of seam will always be long enough.</p>

Creating new objects through pointers
<p>For a lot of new object instantiations, I see the examples using pointers like so:</p>


<div><br/>
<div>    Matrix* m = new Matrix;</div>
<div>    Matrix_init(m, 20, 20);</div>
</div>



<div>Can someone remind me what the difference would be if I instead had</div>



<div>
<div>
<div>    Matrix m = new Matrix;</div>
<div>    Matrix_init(m, 20, 20);</div>
</div>
</div>


<div>where m is no longer a pointer but is the Matrix itself? </div>

-------------------------------------------------
<p>The "new" operator returns a pointer to the newly-created object, so something like "Matrix m = new Matrix;" won't compile due to a type mismatch.</p>


<p>The reason why "new" returns a pointer is because it allocates the new object on the heap, which is typically far away in memory from where the current function's activation record on the stack is. Thus, we need a pointer to that location  on the heap so we can access and modify the object. Don't worry if this doesn't make too much sense yet -- we'll spend a lot of time talking about dynamic allocation later on in lecture!</p>


<p>Quick fun fact: It is possible for the "new" operator to not return a pointer. If the operating system fails to allocate memory for the object at runtime, the "new" operator throws an exception instead. The chance of you encountering this in 280 is exceedingly low. :)</p>

About testing functions
<p>Hi I am wondering if we need to write test functions for every function in Matrix.cpp (even for matrix_init).</p>

<div>i'm rly confused on the bounds? is that right?</div>
</div>
</div>
</div>

-------------------------------------------------
<p>Like you're thinking, you don't want to index out of bounds for our edge cases (col = 0 and col = width - 1). A couple things to keep in mind:</p>


<p></p>


<p>1) when outside matrix.cpp, we want to respect the interface by not directly accessing member variables (e.g. doing cost-&gt;width) . think about how we can use functions we wrote in matrix.cpp to do this</p>


<p></p>


<p>2) Matrix_min_value_in_row() returns the min between column_start inclusive and column_end <em>exclusive </em>. this means we want to input column_end as one past the column we want to check</p>

Energy of a Pixel
<p>I am having trouble finding the energy of a single pixel.</p>


<p>I know that the specs say: </p>


<p></p>


<p>To construct the energy Matrix for the whole image, your function should do the following:</p>


<ol><li>Initialize the energy Matrix with the same size as the Image and fill it with zeros.</li><li>Compute the energy for each non-border pixel, using the formula above.</li><li>Find the maximum energy so far, and use it to fill in the border pixels</li></ol>


<p></p>


<p>but in order to compute the energy of a pixel, I need to use the formula <br/><br/>energy(X) = squared_difference(N, S) + squared_difference(W, E)</p>


<p></p>


<p>and I am not sure what the 'values' of its neighbors are going to be since each pixel has 3 separate values, each for red, green, and blue. </p>

compute_vertical_cost_matrix()

<p></p>


<p>Can someone help explain how we fill in the matrix values for the cost matrix? Is it we add the lowest value in each row above that certain pixel plus the energy of the pixel? Any help would be appreciated :)</p>

-------------------------------------------------
Yep! Each matrix value in cost should be the energy of that pixel plus the lowest value of the three pixels in the row directly above.

-------------------------------------------------
<p>can you explain why we need the lowest three values of the pixels above? </p>

-------------------------------------------------
<p>We don't want the lowest three values of the pixels, but the lowest energy value of the three pixels that are above, above and to the left, and above and to the right of the pixel we're looking at. I don't understand this part of the spec 100% yet, but we basically want to pick the pixel with the lowest energy value so we know what sort of continuous vertical line of pixels we want to remove when we're resizing the image. Watching the demonstration video linked in the spec might help make this part make more sense, too.</p>

Setting values inside Matrix
<p>I am currently working on compute_energy_matrix and have gotten much of the function implementation down, but I wasn't sure if I was able to fill the energy matrix up by calling its data array directly by calling energy-&gt;data  despite not being in the Matrix file itself. Since I there was no prototype for adding an element to the matrix, this seems like it is the only way. Would this method be accepted?</p>

-------------------------------------------------
<p>If you access data directly, you are not respecting the interface, which will cause problems in the future. We recommend using Matrix_at to set pixels outside of the Matrix.cpp file.</p>

Weird error cannot figure out

shorter way of implementing remove_vertical_seam()?
<p>Hi,</p>


<p></p>


<p>For the function remove_vertical_seam(), the RME hints that you should create a smaller image and later delete it. My function works when implemented this way. However, I believe an alternative way to implement this function would be to modify the original matrix: leave the elements before the column to be removed as is, move the elements beyond that one to the left each, then call Matrix_init() and reduce the height and width of the matrix by 1 each. This would run faster due to fewer loops.</p>


<p></p>


<p>Is the efficiency here that important? Which method would you recommend?</p>

-------------------------------------------------
<div class="markdown" id="q38kRj58oo0ooY"><p>We recommend the first way. <code>Matrix_init</code> is meant to be called exactly once to initialize a matrix, and doing the second method would break that desired interface. By using the first method, the efficiency won’t change enough for the autograder to complain.</p></div>

<p>My partner and I have been having an issue and we believe it's in our print function. When we run the public test, it passes and gives us the correct output. However, when we run the provided print basic test, it seems to be printing out red, blue, green, then white, and we can't seem to figure out why. Unless it was an issue with our set pixel function, but I believe we were implementing that one correctly. To set each pixel, we did something like this:</p>


<div>
<div>*Matrix_at(&amp;img-&gt;red_channel,row,column) = color.r;</div>
</div>

-------------------------------------------------
<div class="markdown" id="q38kRj58oo0ooY"><p>Resolved</p></div>

-------------------------------------------------
<p>Wait, I think I just realized the issue. I think our for loop is setting coordinates like 0,0 then 1,0, instead of 0,0 then 0,1 so it's causing them to switch spots.</p>

-------------------------------------------------
<p>Okay, just had to switch up the row and column in the for loop</p>

col_of_min
<p>So, I think I have a basic idea of how to get the min value i'm just confused now on how to keep track of where it is- do I have to use a pointer to simultaneously keep track of the min memory address as I work through finding the min value itself? </p>

-------------------------------------------------
<p>When you are iterating through the matrix, and you find a new min, store its column in a separate variable. When you find a new best min, overwrite your previous min and previous column variables with this new information.</p>

<p>I feel like I am writing the correct function, but ...</p>

-------------------------------------------------
<p>You should use your debugger. It will help you find your bug. If you really don't want to use your debugger, you could stare at your function and do mental math or draw a diagram to envision what is happening. Now, since this function isn't too complex, it mainly relies on the provided function, I don't think it would take that long to find. I would also encourage you to make sure you are not trying to find the energy for the borders of the matrix, as that won't work.</p>

Confused on how to test Image_init with streams
<p>I wrote a test function for Image_init with streams.</p>


<p>I used one of the ppm starter files and printed the output of image_init to a separate txt file.</p>


<p>I was confused on how I could compare the original ppm and the new output txt file and check for differences</p>

<p>For example, if you want to simulate reading in a file like this:</p>

Seam array not being overwritten
<p>Hello, I was having issues with the lobster test case for seam_carve and after some debugging I found that my seam array was not changing with each column that gets reduced. This makes sense with the output I am getting because only the left side of the image is changing (see image). I just don't know why my seam array is not changing and I was wondering if someone could lead me in the right direction. I attached a picture of my code (which is allowed for instructor only posts, right?). I'm sure it's an easy fix but anything I have tried has not worked so far. </p>

Autograder Long Lines Error Due to Given Functions

Image_init confused
Hi, my partner and I started setting up the image_init function. We are wondering if our process/thinking is correct. We first initialized int variables for red, green, and blue. Then we read in the integers representing red, green, and blue in PPM format by using istream.
<br/>
<br/>
However, we are confused on what to do with those red, green, and blue values as we iterate through the ppm file. Do we just set add them to the red, blue, and green channel matrices? Or do we add them to the img, and if so how should we go about that?  Another piazza answer indicated to use Matrix_init(&img->red_channel, width, height), but it's unclear to us how that relates to how we should use the red, green, and blue variables.

-------------------------------------------------
<p>You'll want to use the set pixel function each time you read in new pixel information, but generally you have the right idea. Also you will want to use the Matrix_init function as you stated, you will just also need to use image_set_pixel</p>

-------------------------------------------------

------------------------@921-------------------------
Test functions
<p>Are we required to test all of the image functions? For example, in the print basic function call it uses image_set_pixel as well as Image_init. If we pass the test, are we allowed to assume that those functions are working, or do we still need to provide test cases for every single one?</p>

-------------------------------------------------
<p>Your test cases are only graded on their ability to catch bugs in code that are not your code. You should test your own code to make sure you have no bugs, but within the autograder, they are just testing your cases to see if you catch bugs in sample code that is buggy. If you have all of the mutation points, you no longer need to make test cases.</p>

-------------------------------------------------
<p>There are no points associated with testing every function in Image.cpp, only with catching the required amount of bugs on the autograder. However, I would recommend testing every function you can in Image.cpp to be more confident in your own implementations for private tests.</p>

Array problem
<p>This code makes sense to me, I get the column of the min value starting from the last then count back to the first then I want to set them so that the seam has the column of the min value from the last one as the first thing in that array and then so on.</p>


<p>For my code this makes total sense that it gets that column of the min value from the last row and is putting it as the first thing in the array and so on. But am I equating it to the first thing of the array incorrectly, like it makes sense I don't think there is a better way to do it.</p>

Problem with re-initializing image in remove_vertical_seam function

I know that in the instructions I am supposed to recopy the new array into the other array that is being modified, but I am not so sure of another way of how to do this. May I have some help please? Also, according to my output, my remove_vertical_seam function outputs the correct array. I just need help with the next step of how to reinitialize image.</p>

-------------------------------------------------
<p>I believe the issue is that you're deleting img on line 277, and then you try to use it again on line 278 by sending it to image_init. Image_init expects to be given a pointer to an image, so before calling image_init, you need to create a new Image for img to point to.  </p>

-------------------------------------------------
<p>I am now having this problem when I initialize image again. Do I need to initialize Image under a different name and then do img = img_1?</p>

image_init question
<p>I'm really confused on how to initialize the first image function with the red, green, and blue variables. I tried just calling the Matrix_init three times with img-&gt;red_channel and the other 2 but it's not letting me do that. I'm just a little confused haha</p>

-------------------------------------------------
<p>Which image_init? The first or the second? If it's the first, that's weird, because that's really all you have to do. If the second, it's asking you to Matrix_init, then read in the whole ppm file and put it into the image. It's not as bad as it sounds, just initialize a temp variable, and use "is &gt;&gt; example1 &gt;&gt; example2 &gt;&gt; example3" your variables in and then use image_set_pixel.</p>

-------------------------------------------------
<p>Should I do it with a while loop to iterate through the three values and set the pixel?</p>

-------------------------------------------------
<p>Sorry for the slow response, but that would probably work (like yeah that seems fine :). Personally, I decided to do the following: Since we must start by reading in the beginning of the file (P3, width, height, max), that means that we know the width and the height of the image. So I did a for loop to iterate through it that way. That way, I could read in all of the info from the ppm, by iterating through it, and also set things easily using Image_set_pixel(img, row, column, color). Using a 2D for loop like this seemed a little more convenient :)</p>

-------------------------------------------------
<p>I kind of feel confused about how do i use Matrix_init? what parameter should i pass to it???like:</p>


<p>Matrix_init(&lt;#Matrix *mat#&gt;, &lt;#int width#&gt;, &lt;#int height#&gt;); what *mat and width and height should I passed into it???</p>

-------------------------------------------------
<p>You'll be creating three matrices for each of the channels, and the height and width are read in from the ppm file/passed in as parameters. So you can use those when calling Matrix_init!</p>

<div class="markdown" id="q38kRj58oo0ooY"><p>The range of columns excludes <code>column_end</code> (since it says “exclusive” in EFFECTS).

Matrix _row and Matrix_column use of mat->data
Is it necessary that we use data in our matrix_row and matrix_column functions? It seems like it would make more sense to just use mat->width when doing our arithmetic.

-------------------------------------------------
<p>You're right to use <code>mat-&gt;width</code> in your arithmetic. I found it helpful to be able to use <code>mat-&gt;data</code> to use array decay to find the index of the provided pointer.</p>


<p></p>


<p>After that, it's some simple to convert from an index to a row or column.</p>


<p></p>


<p>However, do remember that the p2 spec says:</p>


<blockquote>
<p><strong>no function other than <code>Matrix_row</code>, <code>Matrix_column</code>, and the two versions of <code>Matrix_at</code> should access the <code>data</code> member directly</strong></p>

Ultimately, this is one of those multitude of ways that C/C++ treats char arrays different than other types of arrays. It was considered a priority to be able to place constant strings off the stack and only keep a small pointer to them on the stack, so that syntax was supported for c-strings.
<div><br/></div>
<div>If we were designing our own language, there’s no reason we couldn’t allow the same thing for other types of arrays.</div>

-------------------------------------------------
<p>Will char *str = "hello" generate another char array that str points to? </p>

-------------------------------------------------
<p>Yes, that puts the string "hello" in a special region of memory that is not allowed to be modified, and puts the pointer "str" on the stack which points to the string.</p>

Issue getting through  2ndImage init
<p>Hi so I'm really confused about how one would initialize the red , blue, and green channel matrices in the struct Image, because we are taking in ints but we are assigning them to channels that are a different type. Also do we use set pixel? If so how do I get the row and column value. Do I have to use width and for loops to find those values , it feels like a lot of for loops.</p>

-------------------------------------------------
<p>I would recommend looking at some previous posts on this Piazza. Try starting here: <a data-pats="post_ref" href="783" onclick="return PE.gotoPost('783');">@783</a></p>

Help with understanding Image_set_pixel
<p>Right now, I'm currently at a complete halt with project because I'm having a hard time understanding how Image_get_pixel works and to even get it working. From my understanding of it, it is selecting a pixel in the image from a specified row and column and setting it to the color of the RGB values from the pixel struct obtained from the Image_get_pixel. The part I don't understand is how does it set it to that color and how does VS code read it as a color?</p>

-------------------------------------------------
<div class="markdown" id="q38kRj58oo0ooY"><p><code>Image_get_pixel()</code> shouldn’t change any values in the <code>Image</code>. That’s what <code>Image_set_pixel()</code> is for. If you look in <code>Image.h</code>, you’ll see that the return type of <code>Image_get_pixel()</code> is <code>Pixel</code>. Your code needs to create a <code>Pixel</code> (you don’t need to use new), set its values to the corresponding values in the red, green, and blue matrices, and then return that <code>Pixel</code>.</p>
<p>To answer the second part of your question, reading color values is super simple because each one is just an <code>int</code>. VS Code doesn’t need to do anything special.</p></div>

Why array decay doesn't happen when we use []?
<p>Let's say there is an array</p>


<p>int arr[3] = {1, 2, 3};</p>


<p>When we use arr[1] to assess its second value, what really happens under the hood to my understanding should be</p>


<p>*(arr+1)</p>


<p>at this time, this arr is already be treated as a pointer and we are doing pointer arithmetic to it, i.e. +1. So why in this case array decay doesn't happen? It doesn't make sense with me.</p>


<p>Thanks!</p>

-------------------------------------------------
I think that’s a fine way of looking at it. It’s ultimately semantics if we want to distinguish between the cases of “that code results in pointer decay” vs “that code is converted to code that results in pointer decay”.

Compute_energy_matrix
<p>I know that we have to call 'square_difference' in Compute_energy_matrix, however, the parameters for that function are pixels. How do we know the exact pixels that we need to pass in? Also, can someone explain how we find N,S,E,W when we don't know where exactly we are in the image.</p>


<p></p>


<p>THANK YOU</p>


<p></p>

-------------------------------------------------
<div class="markdown" id="q38kRj58oo0ooY"><p>To calculate the energy for each non-border pixel X, we use the formula <code>energy(X) = squared\_difference(N, S) + squared\_difference(W, E)</code></p>
<p>The values for N, S, E, and W are simply the adjacent pixels. This is why we only use this method to calculate the energy for non-border pixels. So north is simply <code>row_of_x - 1</code>, east is <code>column_of_x + 1</code>, etc. In a double for loop, you can use those offsets from the current pixel being calculated.</p>
<p>You can also see the explanation in the <a href="https://eecs280staff.github.io/p2-cv/#energy-matrix" rel="noreferrer" target="_blank">p2 spec</a>.</p></div>

Adding ∈ front of the pointer
What does it mean when we put & in front of “p->”? I’m confused here because p-> means we’re dereferencing the parameter but if we put & in front of that what would it mean?

-------------------------------------------------
<div class="markdown" id="q38kRj58oo0ooY"><p>The reason you would use <code>&amp;</code> is because you want a pointer to whatever value you’re getting from p.</p>
<p>For example, in the first <code>Image_init()</code>, you need to initialize the matrices that are in the <code>Image</code> struct using <code>Matrix_init()</code>, which requires a <code>Matrix *</code> pointer. However <code>Image_init()</code> only has an <code>Image *img</code> pointer to work with. By using <code>&amp;(img-&gt;red_channel)</code>, you can get a pointer to the red channel matrix and pass it to <code>Matrix_init()</code>.</p></div>

How to test Matrix_at() while respecting the interface?
<p>When testing Matrix_at(), we must compare the address returned from the function with what we know the true address of the data element to be. However, this isn't a way to get the address of the first element of the data array without directly accessing mat-&gt;data, is there?</p>

-------------------------------------------------
<div class="markdown" id="q38kRj58oo0ooY"><p>Correct. You can access the member variables of Matrix directly here since this function is a core feature of the Matrix object itself. Other functions which utilize Matrix_at should respect the interface, however.</p></div>

-------------------------------------------------
<p>I tried accessing the member variables directly from Matrix but when I ran it through the Autograder it fails the check respecting Matrix interface. We only used mat-&gt;data in Matrix_at tests. How can we fix this are we not allowed to use it in our Matrix_tests.cpp at all.</p>

-------------------------------------------------
<p>You cannot use mat-&gt;data at all in your tests. Because of this, you don't have to test Matrix_at by itself. You can use other functions, or use Matrix_at to check your other functions, to catch bugs for Matrix_at.</p>

-------------------------------------------------

------------------------@947-------------------------
Ok to use other Matrix.cpp functions in our test cases?
<p>For example, is it ok to use Matrix_at() when testing Matrix_row() or Matrix_column()?</p>


<p>Because then I would likewise use Matrix_row() and Matrix_col() when testing Matrix_at().</p>


<p>Theoretically, couldn't this cause an issue if all three implementations are susceptible to the same bug?</p>

-------------------------------------------------
<div class="markdown" id="q38kRj58oo0ooY"><p>Yes. And the bugs are usually specific to one thing that the program can do (i.e. not something that multiple functions are susceptible to). Even if they are, the test would expose the bug regardless.</p></div>

what is red_channel, green channel, blue channel
<p>I know how the PPM and image formed, but I don't know what the red_channel, green channel, and blue channel use for.</p>

-------------------------------------------------
<p>red channel, green channel, blue channel represent the colors that form the image. From red, green, and blue you can form almost all colors so these are used (in combination with each other) to form colors on a screen. In the project your input is given by the values of these three channels (which is why your image struct stores all of them), you then do consistent operations on these channels in order to do seam carving and the other stuff listed in the spec. You need to change all these values (on all the channels) so the output is viewable on a computer in the form of an image.</p>

-------------------------------------------------
<p>So what the red_channel, green channel, and blue channel contain? I know the they are matrix. What is their matrix about? For example, in row 0 and col 0, red pixel is 0, so row 0 and col 0 in red channel is also 0? Sorry I am confused about these three new matrices. <img alt="Screen_Shot_2022-09-24_at_6.19.41_PM.png" src="/redirect/s3?bucket=uploads&amp;prefix=paste%2Fkyjgk5364g37nt%2F140575c5dbf8967705df44ca672c23485bbc0b02885dc5d195339da208b2f9be%2FScreen_Shot_2022-09-24_at_6.19.41_PM.png"/></p>

-------------------------------------------------
<p>Each channel is a matrix of integers. You can think of an image as 3 matrices stacked on top of each other. You can visualize it like thi:</p>


<p><img alt="image.png" height="171" src="/redirect/s3?bucket=uploads&amp;prefix=paste%2Fk02pxl7nct07o2%2F87abe6d634703698e0c25fb87fa7a6ad89b96c7d8fae68d49a85692873dec150%2Fimage.png" width="205"/></p>


<p></p>


<p>A pixel is made up of three values: a red value, a green value, and a blue value. </p>


<p></p>


<p>So at index 0,0, you're correct that the red channel is 0. The green channel and blue channels at that index are also 0.</p>


<p></p>


<p>The pixel at 0,0 is {0, 0, 0}. </p>

About Matrix_at
<p>Hi i have a problem about how to implement matrix_at, I know how to calculate the 1d array index with 2d array index(i.e row and column and width and height), but that will give me the index of that object in 1d array instead of its address, which is a pointer, how can i get the pointer pointing to that object with the index i calculated?</p>


<p></p>


<p> *ptr = row * (mat-&gt;width) + column; I use this expression but i don't think this is correct, cuz when i dereference pointer it gives me a address, but essentially row * (mat-&gt;width) + column give me an index, which is super weird. I am quite unfamiler with c++ syntax, please help!!!</p>


<p></p>


<p></p>

-------------------------------------------------
<p>row, mat-&gt;width, and column are all numbers, so any calculation with them will give you a number, which we can think of as an index. When declaring pointers, we need to set them to the address of objects, not the object's value. </p>


<p></p>


<p>With that being said, if you've figured out how to calculate the index of an element, then you've already accomplished most of this function. An index is essentially how many elements away you are from the beginning of an array. We also know that arrays are represented as pointers to their first element. We can translate the index of an element into the address of an element using pointer arithmetic. </p>

False Positives
<p>Hi, when I put my Matrix_tests.cpp and Matrix.cpp files into the autograder, it says I have false positives in a couple of my tests. I'm a bit confused on how I go about fixing those? What is a false positive too?</p>

-------------------------------------------------
<p>A false positive means that your test case failed on a working example. So when we ran your test cases against our correct solutions, some of them reported a bug when they shouldn't have. This could indicate that you have an incorrect understanding of how some functions should behave based on certain inputs. </p>

<p><strong>Matrix_fill: </strong></p>


<p>You are given a value as a parameter to the function, you want to fill the entire matrix with this value. </p>


<p></p>


<p>You are given mat, which is a pointer to a Matrix object. Matrix has 3 attributes: data, width, height. You need to specify which data attribute you want to access. This is usually done with the dot operator, but since mat is a pointer you need to dereference it first. For example, to access data you would want something like (*mat).data or mat-&gt;data. </p>

P2 spec clarification on Matrix loops
<p>On the Matrix module part of the specs, it says this:</p>


<p></p>


<p>"<em>Your <code>Matrix_at</code> functions will need to perform the appropriate arithmetic to convert from a (row, column) pair to an index in the array, and your <code>Matrix_row</code> and <code>Matrix_column</code> functions will need to go in the other direction. </em><strong><em>None of these functions require a loop, and you’ll find your implementation will be very slow if you use a loop.</em>"</strong></p>


<p><strong></strong></p>


<p>does it mean that only Matrix_at, Matrix_row and Matrix_column don't require a loop or is it talking about all functions in the Matrix module?</p>


<p><strong></strong></p>

-------------------------------------------------
<p>I am not sure about other functions but for these three they don't really need a loop.</p>

-------------------------------------------------
<p>It only means that those three functions mentioned (Matrix_at, Matrix_row, Matrix_column) shouldn't be completed using loops. You will have to use loops to implement some other functions in Matrix.cpp</p>

resize.cpp Memory leak
<p>Hello,</p>


<p>I have been testing my resize.cpp function to see what it would do if I gave it an invalid input. My file did crash and return the proper error message when I used an invalid input, but it also detected a memory leak because I needed to declare a new *img before I could check its width/height. Since my program exited before deleting the *img, it causes a memory leak. Is there a way to change my code to avoid this memory leak or is it important? I could put delete img in the if statement checking for the invalid input, but I check for multiple errors throughout my code so I was wondering if there was a better way to avoid a memory leak.</p>


<p><img alt="image.pngNaN" height="734" src="/redirect/s3?bucket=uploads&amp;prefix=paste%2Fksy2v236ihf38t%2F51ccf007a85a864f9c1822a11a07490c13e2af7846e6e4829b09c56704025998%2Fimage.png" width="643"/></p>

-------------------------------------------------
<p>You should reorganize the code to avoid any memory leaks. This can come in the form of deleting your img on every return, or only creating the img after you check error conditions. How you go about it is up to you, but there should be no memory leaks present in your code.</p>

compute_vertical_cost_matrix
<p>so I get the idea of it and how to use min_value_in_row for it. im struggling to understand how to index using the function though. </p>


<p>because min_value_in_row excludes the column_end value passed into it, i was thinking of passing ((the col value I want) + 1), but won't that cause indexing issues? any help would be appreciated </p>

-------------------------------------------------
<div class="markdown" id="q38kRj58oo0ooY"><p>Assuming you implemented the min_val_in_row function, you shouldn’t encounter an indexing issue.</p></div>

-------------------------------------------------
<p>Where was the min_val_in_row function? Are you talking about Matrix_min_value_in_row? That does not account for out-of-bounds indexing.</p>

-------------------------------------------------
<p>Your Matrix_min_value_in_row function should index to (column_end -1).</p>


<p>So if you have a 5x5 matrix for example, and you want to look from column 0 to column 4 (across the entire row), you would pass in column_end as 5. Since you will only index up to 4, this won't cause an out_of_bounds error.</p>

<p>You can also look at the RME to confirm this.</p>

<p>#1 For the first image_init function, how would we initialize the red, blue, and green channels (or do we even have to)</p>


<p>#2 For the image_set_pixel and image_get_pixel, we currently have this coded. We have tried to get it to pass the public image test but it keeps failing. I have continuously tried to look at related piazza posts, but I can not seem to pinpoint the issue. I am aware it is related to a indexing issue with Matrix_at, but we do not know how to fix this. I have attached what the terminal prints when we run this. Any advice would be greatly appreciated.</p>

<div class="markdown" id="q38kRj58oo1ooY"><p>What specific test is failing? And where does it fail?</p></div>

-------------------------------------------------
<p>When I run the Image_public_test, this is the error the terminal gives me. I believe it is failing at line 30/31 in image_public_test when image_fill and image_get_pixel is run. Image_set_pixel is called in image_fill. Both image_set_pixel and image_get_pixel call Matrix_at in their implementation, so it makes sense why the terminal is giving me this error, and I think it is causing the issue, but I don't know how to fix it. My partner and I have tested the matrix.cpp files extensively and they catch all the bugs in the autograder as well. </p>

Fill-border test case: value appears after the indices
<p>I've been testing the fill_border function in 5x5 matrix, and matrices printed out 42 around the borders as expected.</p>

<p>However there is a 42 on index 30 (<a href="/redirect/s3?bucket=uploads&amp;prefix=paste%2Fkszctriqgxu71e%2F212f3aba97cae80b548332ff2a20a69c2bbd46c98156a1364f1b4eba1c4339f6%2FScreen_Shot_2022-09-24_at_1.58.54_PM.png" rel="noreferrer" target="_blank">Screen_Shot_2022-09-24_at_1.58.54_PM.png</a>), and the unit test I made said that 42 does match with index 30 (<a href="/redirect/s3?bucket=uploads&amp;prefix=paste%2Fkszctriqgxu71e%2Fd1262e7a142090d2c49950979d73d9a35785c50518e1a962c2e565b5aaefcd60%2FScreen_Shot_2022-09-24_at_2.08.26_PM.png" rel="noreferrer" target="_blank">Screen_Shot_2022-09-24_at_2.08.26_PM.png</a>)</p>

<p></p>


<p>Thank you so much for your kind help!</p>

-------------------------------------------------
<p>As you point out, index 30 is out of bounds in a 5x5 matrix. You should not worry about what the values that are outside the bounds of your matrix as they could theoretically be anything. I would not assert the value of out of bounds indices as it may not be 42 the next time you run the unit test.</p>

matrix_fill error
<p>Hi, </p>

Memory error with Image_set_pixel
<p>Hi, I recently asked a question about how to access color info in Image_set_pixel and I changed my approach to access and set *img using this notation:  *(Matrix_at(&amp;img-&gt;red_channel, row, column)) = color.r;</p>


<p>However, when I run tests on my terminal, I am still getting this error message and I am really confused how this is undefined behavior. Thank you!</p>

<p>We realized that we didn't need a loop for set_pixel if were using *(Matrix_at(&amp;img-&gt;red_channel, row, column)) to get the red value and assign that to color.r, but we're still getting these sanitizer/out of bounds errors.

Image get pixel
I’m having a hard time understanding this function. I know that pixel is formed with three integers and the integers represent red, green, and blue and the image get pixel unpacks these and store each of the integer color values(?) to each of the matrix(red_channel, green_channel, blue_channel). And if we look at the parameters of this it contains row and column. But I don’t understand what will happen if we call Matrix_at and put these row and column parameters for each of the color matrices. For instance, if the row is 2 and the column is 3 with the red_channel matrix, does it mean that it will point to an element of row 2 column 3 of the red_channel matrix and return the integer (intensity of the red color)?

-------------------------------------------------
<p>Your intuition about this function seems correct to me. With row, column parameters of 2 and 3, the Image_get_pixel function should access each of the images channel matrices (red_channel, green_channel, and blue_channel) and save their values at row 2, column 3 into a pixel struct which should be returned.</p>

Does autograder give feedback for invalid tests immediately after I submit, or after the deadline?
<p>Hi, as the title, does the Autograder give out feedback for valid/invalid unit tests immediately after I submit, or after the deadline?</p>


<p>Say, I wrote several tests but failed to catch a certain bug, will the autograder let me know immediately? And would the autograder let me know what is the input?</p>

-------------------------------------------------
<p>The AG will only tell you how many bugs you're catching, and how many points out of the maximum possible number of points you're getting for your test cases. This output is visible after submitting your test cases, and test case scores are final (meaning the score you see on the AG is the score you will receive for test cases, even after private tests are run)</p>

Testing Image_Init

-------------------------------------------------
<div class="markdown" id="q38kRj58oo0ooY"><p>You cannot submit extraneous txt files to the autograder, so you cannot use <code>fstream</code> for your Image tests. Instead, you have to use stringstreams for these kinds of tests. You can think of a stringstream as “acting” like standard input/output or file input/output, but instead of the source being the command line or a file, it’s a string.</p>
<p>For example, if you want to simulate reading in a file like this:</p>
<pre><code>P3
1 1
255
42
</code></pre><p>You can declare a string with that content, initialize an input string stream (an <code>istringstream</code>) with that string as the content, and then read it in like a file or standard input.</p>

-------------------------------------------------
<p>What you want to do is write test cases in matrix_tests.cpp, you should start with writing a test case for each function in matrix.cpp, then add more to catch some edge cases. I'm not sure if you are running the public test or the provided test case in matrix_tests.cpp, but what your output means is that you did not pass the test case and you have to debug it to figure out why</p>

Trying to copy image to another image before putting it back
<p>So my plan for remove vertical seam was that I copy each element of image into another image which I can edit. SO im doing the usual loop through each row and column then equate them to the original element but it keeps saying that the way im equatiing them is incorrect but ive been doin this for everything and it works?</p>


<p><img alt="image.png" src="/redirect/s3?bucket=uploads&amp;prefix=paste%2Fky11a69k1rc6qq%2F9cb595bbcdf18b0c2e3f7914e8868e7c6b45ab66788eb22ff2b714aad8548fbb%2Fimage.png"/></p>

-------------------------------------------------
<p>Take a look at the parameters that the Matrix_at function takes in, and double check what you are passing into the function. You may find it easier to use the functions in Image.cpp for the task of copying pixels between the two images.</p>

Calling Matrix functions inside Image.cpp
<p>Hello! I see that we need to respect the interface when we script our functions, however, I am just wondering if calling functions from Matrix.cpp in Image.cpp would be disrespecting the interface. Unless calling functions from Matrix.cpp in Image.cpp is unnecessary, does anyone have any ideas or tips?</p>

-------------------------------------------------
<p>I think you can, and it is even encouraged, to use the matrix.cpp functions in the image.cpp</p>

-------------------------------------------------
<p>You will want to call the functions in Matrix.cpp in Image.cpp. In order to "respect the interface", you should not directly access members of the Matrix struct in Image.cpp (mat-&gt;height, mat-&gt;width, mat-&gt;data).</p>

<p>Hmm, okay. The compiler's giving me this error when I "make" Image_tests.exe. Is there any reason why? I've tried including Matrix.h in Image.cpp, but that doesn't seem to be the problem.</p>

-------------------------------------------------
<p>It seems like your row and column variables may be pointers, while the Matrix_at function takes in a pointer to a Matrix, an int for row, and an int for column.</p>

-------------------------------------------------
<p>Thanks, I got it fixed now 👍.</p>

compute_energy_matrix position?
<p>In compute_energy_matrix, it wants you to use the pixels N,E,S,W of the pixel you're currently on to compute the energy. How do you find the pixel you're currently on? I tried to use Matrix_row and Matrix_column to find the row and column to then get N,E,S,W, but I'm confused on what I'm supposed to pass into those.</p>


<p></p>


<p>I have three values for the img red/blue/green channels, so which am I passing to those functions? </p>

-------------------------------------------------
<div class="markdown" id="q38kRj58oo0ooY"><p>You should be looping through the image to compute the energy matrix. At each pixel, use that pixel’s row and column to compute the energy value for that cell.</p></div>

compute_energy_matrix matrix initialization
<p>Hi, right now I'm having a hard time trying to initialize the energy matrix that would be used in compute_energy_matrix. I've tried using both the first Image_init and Matrix_init separately but I haven't really been able to get them working. Is there another way to initialize the matrix used here or was it one of the previous options I tried but failed to do correctly?</p>

-------------------------------------------------
<p>energy is a pointer to a Matrix object, so you would want to use Matrix_init and not Image_init. The Effects statement for this function says that the energy matrix needs to be initialized to be the same size as the Image pointed to by img. I would recommend taking a look at the Matrix_init function and making sure you're sending it the correct parameters. </p>

Confusion with Matrix_at and const Matrix_at
<p>I am not sure how I can test if const Matrix_at is working. I tried setting up the constant pointer, filled the indices into a single value, and modified one of the indices; but when I stepped through the debugger, the Matrix_at function on the second line gets called to the non-const version. </p>


<p></p>


<p>Also, I'm not sure the difference between dereferencing the constant pointer and the Matrix_at function and why would they return different results?</p>


<p><img alt="" height="166" src="/redirect/s3?bucket=uploads&amp;prefix=paste%2Fkszctriqgxu71e%2Fb4e423292f346cc581a98ca1efdbce669867f3049a5214185a583c60702814c0%2FScreen_Shot_2022-09-24_at_4.07.06_PM.png" width="650"/></p>


<p></p>


<p>I would really appreciate any suggestions of how I can test this function. </p>

-------------------------------------------------
<p>I changed this post to private - please don't include any code in a public post. </p>


<p></p>


<p>Did you declare mat as a pointer to const as well? If mat is not a pointer to a const matrix, then the other Matrix_at will be called, which I believe is what is happening in this situation. To test the matrix_at that takes a pointer-to-const, you need to send it a pointer to a const matrix in the parameters. </p>


<p></p>


<p>You get an error when you try to dereference stay because stay is declared as a pointer to const, and you're not supposed to be able to alter the value that it points to. You don't get an error at the dereference to matrix_at because, like you pointed out in your post, I believe you're calling the non-const Matrix_at. </p>

processing_public_tests crabster
<p>Hi, I passed all the processing public tests, except for crabster. The error output shows there is no output. May I ask what file should I check to find a solution? Many thanks! <img alt="Screen_Shot_2022-09-24_at_4.13.59_PM.pngNaN" src="/redirect/s3?bucket=uploads&amp;prefix=paste%2Fl7b69no9x5g28c%2F57baad5fbec942affd8b09e04abed5ce5da51263f14a0d5aa487a4a445dd426b%2FScreen_Shot_2022-09-24_at_4.13.59_PM.png"/></p>

-------------------------------------------------
<p>Based on the Autograder output, it looks like the test for seam carve 70x35 fails. Have you tried running the crabster processing public tests from your terminal? </p>

-------------------------------------------------
<p>Yes. When I ran the processing public test, it showed "segmentation faults".<img alt="Screen_Shot_2022-09-24_at_7.27.52_PM.pngNaN" src="/redirect/s3?bucket=uploads&amp;prefix=paste%2Fl7b69no9x5g28c%2F5a79c36e2bd4f4b6e8123a48e6a72f7fbe24488e16574152923ab2b299388172%2FScreen_Shot_2022-09-24_at_7.27.52_PM.png"/></p>

-------------------------------------------------
<p>A segmentation fault usually occurs when you index an array or vector out of range. You can try using your debugger to see where the seg fault is occurring, or feel free to come to office hours for more guidance!</p>

Help understanding the implementation of the second Image_init
<p>As per my understanding, the 1st image_init function is used to set the width and the height of the image and the second image_init reads a given ppm file and splits the r,g,b values into their respective channels. Is the pixel struct invovled in any of this? moreover, would we need to use functions like image_set_pixel to achieve this? My intuition tells me some looping system is involved but I'm having trouble visualizing how to implement it.</p>

-------------------------------------------------
<div class="markdown" id="q38kRj58oo0ooY"><p>There are a few ways to implement it, some using Pixel and some not. At its core, the function must:</p>
<ol><li>Read in the width and height to initialize the image and matrices</li><li>Read in each pixel (set of three numbers)</li><li>Assign the three numbers to the red, green, and blue channels respectively (at that specific row/column)</li></ol></div>

-------------------------------------------------

------------------------@983-------------------------
Is this the correct way to store numbers in red, green, and blue channel in image_init()?
<p>I used "is" to read red &gt;&gt; green &gt;&gt; blue, then I store each number corresponding to red to red_channel. The same thing happens to green and blue channels. Am I doing it right?</p>

-------------------------------------------------
<p>Using gitLab is not compulsory and there's no way for us to know if you use it or not. With that being said, it's a good idea to use it for version control and as a backup of your code. </p>

Compute_vertical_cost_matrix()
<p>Hello,</p>


<p></p>


<p>I was debugging my code, and when I went to my compute_vertical_cost_matrix function, I realized that I was violating the requires clause of the matrix_min_value_in_row() when I was doing the edge case for when calculating the matrix pixel on the last column. </p>


<p></p>


<p>What I currently have is Matrix_min_value_in_row(cost, row - 1, col, col + 2), but when I do col + 2, it goes out of bounds. The only reason I am doing col + 2 is because the RME for matrix_min_value_in_row says that the function is exclusive on the column end part. </p>


<p></p>


<p>Any help would be appreciated :)</p>

-------------------------------------------------
<p>I think I found the problem here. Even when the function is exclusive on the last column, you don't need to do col + 2, just do col + 1 instead. This way, if your for loop has (index &lt; col_end), it will never actually try to index out of bounds. Right now, with your code, it indexes at data[col + 1], which is not possible. So I think changing the +2 to a +1 would fix the problem. </p>


<p></p>


<p></p>

-------------------------------------------------
<p>I am having this problem as well, and I'm not sure if I can use the min function since that's in the algorithm library.</p>

-------------------------------------------------
<p>you can it says on the spec</p>

-------------------------------------------------
<p>algorithm is not allowed. i submitted to AG with it and got a error message saying it is not allowed. </p>

-------------------------------------------------
But min is in the std lib, not algorithm lib

-------------------------------------------------
<p>even then, spec says to use the min function we made</p>

-------------------------------------------------
Sorry sir, it is a stupid question: what’s spec…

Image
Just like Matrix, do we also have to think of Image as a 1D array?

-------------------------------------------------
<div class="markdown" id="q38kRj58oo0ooY"><p>No, the only abstraction was that the Matrix in real implementation was a 1D array. Outside of the implementation, Matrix is supposed to look and be used like a 2D array. Because Image is using Matrix, you only have to see the abstraction and not the implementation, so you can think of the three red, green, blue matrices as a 2D arrays from the outside.</p></div>

<p>Is one way closer than the other and can someone please explain what I am doing wrong?</p>


<p>Also, where can I find all the things I can #include?</p>

<p>I would encourage you to think about whether you need to traverse the Matrix by pointer, or if there is a way you could achieve visiting every element of the Matrix by traversing the rows and columns by index using other functions in Matrix.cpp.</p>

testing matrix_column and matrix_row
<p>Since I used mat-&gt;data within the implementation of my matrix_column and matrix_row functions, should I be creating a custom Matrix <span style="text-decoration:underline">data array</span> for the sake of testing? The initial address changes every time I create a matrix using matrix_init and matrix_fiill. I'm currently testing Matrix_column_of_min_value_in_row, and I believe the address of mat-&gt;data is changing which is causing my answer for matrix_column to change. The reason I think this is because of my result for Matrix_column_of_min_value_in_row changing seemingly at random. Even if I don't alter the code at all, running a test on the Matrix_column_of_min_value_in_row function repeatedly will give various results - some passing, some not. When I step through with the debugger the error seems to come from my matrix_column exactly when I access the mat-&gt;data. I'm pretty stuck.</p>

-------------------------------------------------
<p>You should not have to access mat-&gt;data in your testing of the Matrix.cpp functions. Is there a function you could use from Matrix.cpp that will access mat-&gt;data for you at a specific row and column?</p>

Unit Tests Combining
<p>For the unit tests, can we structure unit test  like:</p>


<p></p>


<p>//would test the print function of matrix with cout stream </p>


<p></p>


<p></p>


<p>TEST(Matrix_print_cout){</p>


<p>// different size matrixes </p>


<p>...</p>


<p></p>


<p>//compare with correct output and function output and save as bool value</p>


<p>...</p>


<p></p>


<p>//one assert statement that only returns true with all the statements are true. </p>


<p>...</p>


<p>}</p>

<p>Would that structure be a bad set-up?</p>

Image_init makes all values null at the end of the function
<p>When we and my partner are trying to use image_init (the first one), use matrix_init for the rgb color channels and unitialize height and width.

Do I need to do test cases or should I
<p>Hi, so I noticed that there aren't test files for the processing and resize .cpp functions. Do I need to worry about edge cases or test cases if my program passes all of the public tests for those files? Like should I create another file of my own to test them or will the public test be enough?</p>

-------------------------------------------------
It is recommended to test everything to make sure the they work as expected. But you only need to submit matrix and image tests for credits.

What are Mutation Testing Suites and how are they graded
<p>Where should I start for the "exposed bugs"?</p>

-------------------------------------------------
<p>A mutation test suite is a set of unit tests that are run against buggy implementations of code. You get points based on if your test case reveals those bugs (for example, if your test case is run against an incorrect <code>Matrix_fill</code> function, you will get a point if your test case fails, which means it found that bug). You can write test cases as normal just like you did in p1; be sure to think about different edge cases for your <code>Matrix</code> and <code>Image</code> functions!</p>

<p><a data-pats="post_ref" href="921" onclick="return PE.gotoPost('921');">@921</a> includes a helpful explanation as well.</p>

-------------------------------------------------
<p>Hi, just to make sure: the Testing Suites are testing whether or not my test cases (unit tests) are robust enough. But how is the autograding testing that? Is it going to offer a buggy version of the functions and see if the test cases catches it by failing?</p>

<p>Yup, your explanation is correct. You can think of each point on the AG as a different buggy solution.</p>

remove_vertical_seam() confusion
<p>I read on an earlier post that I should point the pointer that points to the original image matrix over to the copy matrix, but I don't know how that would work since we delete the copy at the end. It works on the debugger until the debugger exits out of the function, then the original image loses the dimensions of the copy and has its old dimensions again. Would anyone be able to help me with this?</p>

-------------------------------------------------
<p>The phrasing in your post "point the pointer that points to the original image matrix over to the copy matrix" is a bit misleading, as you are correct in that the final image has to be deleted through that same pointer. Instead, think about it as copying the data inside the pointer from the auxiliary image to the original image. </p>

seam[height] compilation warning in Processing.cpp
<p>We are receiving a compilation warning in autograder for our processing.cpp in our seam_carve_width function. It says C++ forbids variable length array 'seam' in int seam[height]... where we wrote int height = Image_height(img) on the line above. We understand that arrays are not allowed to vary in length. But we don't know how to maneuver this compilation warning with the purpose of the function. </p>

-------------------------------------------------
<p>Seam doesn't necessarily need to equal the height. It simply needs to be at least as long as the height. This is similar to how <kbd>data</kbd> in <kbd>Matrix</kbd> is the maximum possible length required—not the exact length needed for a specific height and width. With that in mind, consider using a constant variable (that we were given in a .h file) to set <kbd>seam</kbd> to be a length which is always greater than or equal to height.</p>

-------------------------------------------------
<p>I tried to initialize the array using int seam[500]; but I got a compile error:</p>


<p></p>


<p><img alt="" height="113" src="/redirect/s3?bucket=uploads&amp;prefix=paste%2Fkszansx1wf6768%2F7a831388d4cbc70be5ac8ad6954620e3ef0e7c8cd6ff78e76394f2d5c99bbc4f%2FScreen_Shot_2022-09-25_at_10.01.13_PM.png" width="719"/></p>

-------------------------------------------------
<p>Have you put <kbd>int seam[500];</kbd> inside of <kbd>find_minimal_vertical_seam</kbd> or inside of <kbd>seam_carve_width</kbd>? </p>

-------------------------------------------------
<p>I'm confused, because for remove_vertical_seam() one of the requirements is that the size of seam must be equal to Image_height(img). Wouldn't using seam[500] violate this requirement? Also, shouldn't seam be initialized outside of those functions?</p>

-------------------------------------------------
<p>Yes, seam should be initialized outside of those functions. It should be initialized in a function which has to call a function that has a parameter of <kbd>int seam[]</kbd>... say inside of <kbd>seam_carve_width</kbd>.</p>


<p></p>


<p>As for <kbd>remove_vertical_seam()</kbd>'s requirement that the size of <kbd>seam</kbd> must be equal to <kbd>Image_height(img)</kbd>, I believe this is a small typo in the RME. For <kbd>find_minimal_vertical_seam()</kbd>, the requirement is "the size of <kbd>seam</kbd> is &gt;= <kbd>Matrix_height(cost)</kbd>." (And the height of the cost matrix and the image are the same). If we think about it, there's no reason that seam can't be too long... we just stop reading when we're done reading the information we need, even if it's too long. However, it at least has to be as long as the image. Since we can't set the length dynamically (the problem you encountered when making this post), we have to set it to the fixed maximum length.</p>


<p></p>


<p>Lastly, note that <kbd>int seam[500];</kbd> will work for the purposes of the grade on this project, but you may consider using <kbd>int seam[MAX_MATRIX_HEIGHT];</kbd> instead in case you want to change the <kbd>MAX_MATRIX_HEIGHT</kbd> later (say, to put your own photos in). This is just good coding practice.</p>

<p><strong>Q: Rotate left is failing, even though it was provided. Is there an error in the provided function?</strong> <br/>A: Rotate left calls several student implemented image functions, which can cause errors in rotate left.</p>

using min value row "backwards"
<p>For the min value function (not the column one), can we use it backwards? For example, can we have column_start be towards the right side of the matrix and column_end be towards the left side and read the range of values from right to left instead of the traditional left to right?</p>


<p></p>


<p>Thank you in advance.</p>

-------------------------------------------------
<p>Your min_value_in_row function should do what the RME specifies; specifically, column_start needs to be the left boundary, and column_end needs to be one past the right boundary. You can read from right to left or left to right within the function.</p>

What does it mean to copy an image?

-------------------------------------------------
<div class="markdown" id="q38kRj58oo0ooY"><p>Nice to hear that you have solved this.</p>
<p>Think of this <code>*img = *aux</code> as copying the “content” of aux to img, because when you dereferencing the pointer, you will get the actual struct that is pointed by the vector.

remove vertical seam output doesn't seem to compare properly
<p>I am currently running into a problem where my output is not correct.

-------------------------------------------------
<p>Think about whether we should be copying over memory addresses, or the actual data inside img_new.</p>


<p></p>


<p>Additionally, if your output looks exactly the same on terminal to the correct output, it may be good to use a diff checker to see if there's any whiteshape differences.  If you run </p>


<pre>sdiff file1.txt file2.txt</pre>
<p>it will compare the two files for differences.</p>

using operators with const int and int
<p>I'm just curious and want to know the explanation of why the reference operator * lets me able to use the other operators such as &lt;, &gt;, = while comparing these two but without it, I would get an error.</p>

<div class="markdown" id="q38kRj58oo0ooY"><p>If I’m understanding the question correctly, <code>num1</code> is a pointer while <code>num2</code> is an int. You can’t compare these types directly, so you need to dereference <code>num1</code> by using <code>*num1</code> in order to compare it to <code>num2</code>. The const operator does not change this; what matters is the pointer type.</p></div>

Matix_at use of mat -> data.
If mat -> data is defined as max_height * max_width (500^2), is there a more useful way to reference this within our matrix_at function? If say I had a height=3 width=4 matrix, wouldn't it be much more useful if mat -> data = 12 than 500^2?
<br/>
Not sure if I'm just misunderstanding the way it's initialized, but any clarification would help.

-------------------------------------------------
<p>mat -&gt; data is an array with size max_height * max_width, not the integer max_height * max_width.</p>


<p></p>


<p>In c++ you can't really have arrays with variable size so the memory is allocated using the maximum size of the array even if the entire array isn't used.</p>

-------------------------------------------------
<p>You can treat mat-&gt;data as if it only has 12 elements in it even when the actual initialized size is much larger. Our member variables matrix-&gt;height and matrix-&gt;width help us with indexing in bounds of the data</p>

Testing processing.cpp
<p>Hello,</p>


<p>I was wondering if anyone knows a good strategy for how to write tests for processing.cpp since the correct energy and cost matrices take a long time to calculate. Also, if we write tests for processing.cpp in a copy of processing_public_tests.cpp, how should we compile the file? Should we add a command to the Makefile?</p>

-------------------------------------------------
<p>When testing processing.cpp, I would suggest writing smaller test cases of computing the energy and cost matrix so that it does not take as long to calculate. Smaller test cases (maybe a 7 by 7 ish size) are something you can generate a correct output for. Make sure that these test cases are targeted though! Think about all the bounds and if statements in your function. The test case should attempt to run every single line and if condition in the function.</p>

Remove_vertical_seam()

red, green, blue channel
<p>What the red_channel, green channel, and blue channel contain? I know the they are matrix. What is their matrix about? For example, in row 0 and col 0, red pixel is 0, so row 0 and col 0 in red channel is also 0? Sorry I am confused about these three new matrices.</p>

-------------------------------------------------
<p>Essentially the red,green, and blue channels are just matrices that are storing the RGB values at each pixel but in separate matrices. For example if I have a 2x2 image, the pixel at row = 0, column = 0 will have one set of RGB values.</p>


<p>The first value in my red_channel will be the R value for that pixel also at row = 0, column = 0. The same applies to the blue and green channels. Also let's say I wanted to access my RGB values at some random pixel in the image, then</p>


<p>I would use my Matrix_at function (because red_channel is a matrix) with the statement "&amp;img-&gt;red_channel" to access that R value. </p>


<p></p>


<p>Basically, each color_channel is another matrix that has the corresponding color values at the same row and column as your image.</p>

remove_vertical_seam
<p>Currently stuck right now with remove_vertical_seam as I can't get the column in each row stored by seam to be skipped when copying the pixels from img to a temporary img as it seems to read what should be the skipped values.

assert not working?
<p>Hi, I have no idea of how to create an assert for a REQUIRES clause. It reads:</p>


<div>
<div>the size of seam is == Image_height(img)</div>
<div>But whenever I use the sizeof function(I use it correctly - sizeof(seam)/sizeof(seam[0]) is supposed to return the size of the array) but because the array is of const ints it doesn't work. Any ideas?</div>
</div>

-------------------------------------------------
<p><a data-pats="post_ref" href="894" onclick="return PE.gotoPost('894');">@894</a> talks about this, but to reiterate, there's no good way to actually assert that the REQUIRES clause is met.

About the image_print
<p>Hi i have some problems about understanding and implement image_print, it's a void function but in RME it says</p>


<p>"Writes the image to the given output stream in PPM format", does it mean we literally need to print/os sth??? And also when we say:</p>


<p>"</p>


<p>Next, prints out the rows of the image, each followed by a</p>


<p>//           newline. Each pixel in a row is printed as three ints</p>


<p>//           for its red, green, and blue components, in that order. "</p>


<p></p>


<p>we are trying to use img-&gt;red_channel and other matrices to get the info in each pixel and print them out right???</p>

-------------------------------------------------
<p>To my understanding, the image_print function just needs to print the info using some sort of output stream, so in my function I just used os &lt;&lt; "whatever I want to print out" and this still means the function is void.</p>


<p>Also to your second question, yes. I think I read in some other post that the statement "&amp;img-&gt;red_channel" will be used frequently in order to access the RGB values at that pixel.</p>

Completely lost on broken assert
<p>One of my asserts keeps failing - a simple one, which is:</p>


<div>
<div>assert(column &gt;= 0 &amp;&amp; column &lt; Matrix_width(mat));</div>
<div>Everything, every line of code I have in place makes sure that column does not go over Matrix_width.</div>
<div>In compute_energy_matrix, I use matrix_init, setting the width and height to the image's width and height.</div>
<div>I do not loop past the bounds of the matrix's dimensions, which are identical to the image's dimensions. The column is always &gt;= 0 and always less than the Matrix width. And yet, the assert fails.</div>
</div>



<div>How? I don't understand at all, when I remove the assert and run the code it outputs exactly the correct response. But when I put it back in, it should not fail but it does. The row assert that does the exact same thing works just fine. Any ideas?</div>

-------------------------------------------------
I would look at the function RME, verify your assert does exactly what the RME requires. If it does, try using a break point before the assert to see the values being sent into the function.

-------------------------------------------------
<p>As the student suggests, the debugger is your best resource in a situation like this. It will help you trace through the functions called to get you to your current state, and show you the local variable values along the way. If you are still stuck, consider visiting office hours to get some help stepping through it with a member of the course staff.</p>

<p>do i have to create separate for loops for these columns since the algorithm given in the specs:</p>

dog.ppm automatically generating
<p>I noticed that whenever I call the resize.exe program via make -j, the program automatically generates dog_4x5.out without me having to put in the code, but when I separately resize a picture by typing in ./resize.exe onto shell, it doesn't generate the image (I haven't implemented this part yet).</p>

Matrix_public_test.cpp question

<p></p>


<p>Matrix_public_test.exe: Matrix.cpp:89: int* Matrix_at(Matrix*, int, int): Assertion `0 &lt;= column &amp;&amp; column &lt; Matrix_width(mat)' failed.<br/>Aborted (core dumped)</p>

<div>  int* element_ptr = ptr1 + column;</div>
<div>  return element_ptr;</div>
<div>}</div>
</div>



<div>This is what our Matrix_at function looks like, but the public test makes it seem like we are going out of the bounds we set for the function with assert(). Any assistance would be greatly appreciated, thank you.</div>

-------------------------------------------------
<p>If your assert statement is causing the function to fail, this would likely be a result of the function calling Matrix_at, not Matrix_at itself. Double check the parameters you're passing into Matrix_at for the function call at Matrix_public_test.</p>

-------------------------------------------------
<p>The parameters in the public test are within the bounds (matrix_at 2 and 3 within matrix_init 5 x 5). We are met with the same error on autograder. We were not the ones who wrote the test, so we shouldn't need to adjust the test. It might be an issue with our actual matrix_at function, but we are not too sure what it may be. The only thing that I can imagine is that it's an issue with the line that has an &amp; (and in result, the line thereafter as well).</p>

<p>Could you clarify what you don't understand about these instructions?</p>


<p></p>


<p>1. Initialize the cost matrix</p>


<p></p>


<p>2. Fill in the index 0 row with its energy values (It is the first row so there are no previous energy values to add to the cost)</p>


<p></p>


<p>3. Loop through the matrix starting from row index 1, the cost for each pixel is the min value of the adjacent columns of the cost row that you filled in the previous iteration + the energy of the pixel itself. You can find this using the Matrix_min_value_in_row on the previous row of the cost matrix and adding that to the Matrix_at of the current pixel in the energy matrix. </p>

<p>This is because the definition on the left is of type int* and the expression on the right evaluates to a const int*. You could change the definition to be a const int*, but then you may run into issues with changing this const value.</p>


<p></p>


<p>You can, and should, use the other functions in Matrix.cpp to access the pointers and traverse for the Matrix_column_of_min_value_in_row function. This will take care of the arithmetic and pointer accesses you are attempting in this code snippet, and should greatly simplify the implementation.</p>

Do we have to check all REQUIRES clause
<p>Hi, I want to ask whether we need to check all REQUIRES clause in our umolementation. In the mat_init function, there is a requirement that the pointer should points to a matrix. I am not sure how to assert that. Thank you so much!</p>

remove vertical seam
<p>it looks like when we compare our column to seam[r], seam always points to the first index, but we don't know any other type of pointer arithmetic to try. we tried seam[r +count] and incremented count when the inner loop finished iterating but that did not work.</p>


<p></p>


<p>also with the debugger we stepped into processing_public_tests line 178 and looked at the removed_img_correct and our output did not match that but it does match dog_removed.correct.ppm</p>

-------------------------------------------------
<p>What exactly are you trying to do? seam[r] will only point to the first index if the value of r is 0.</p>


<p></p>


<p>For this function I looped through the rows and columns of the image with two for loops, compared the column of the loop with the seam column of index row and set the pixel of the new image to the correct pixel of the original image if the two columns were not the same.</p>

-------------------------------------------------
<p>i also used a nested for loop but dog_out.ppm and dog_removed.correct.ppm are literally identical but it is not passing in autograder or the terminal</p>

-------------------------------------------------
<p>If they look identical, my only guess would be an issue with whitespace. Check your Image_print to make sure that it is following the guidelines for white space indicated in the RME.</p>

Mutation Testing Suites Error
Hi, in my mutation testing suites, I have some test functions that say they give false positives and some that are valid; however they are for the same function and are implemented the same. Is there any explanation for that?

-------------------------------------------------
<div class="markdown" id="q38kRj58oo0ooY"><p>If you’re saying that two tests are exactly the same but one gives a false positive, I think that this is impossible. I would recommend running through with your debugger to see if the inputs to your test are any different.</p>
<p>If you’re saying that there are two tests testing the same function but one is giving a false positive, then that means your asserts in one test is incorrect, or in other words your asserts are invalid when tested against a correct implementation.</p>
<p>An example of a false positive:
vec = {10,20,30}
ASSERT_TRUE(sum(vec) == 3); // this is not valid, the answer should be 60</p></div>

Stuck on find_minimal_vertical_seam
<p>Hello, I am currently stuck on the find_vertical_seam function. The cost and energy calculation functions seem to be working correctly as they pass the assertions for their tests in the processing public test file, however upon running the tests for finding the vertical seam it does not produce the expected output.

debugging processing.cpp seam carve for public test
<p>In the processing_public_tests our code passes the dog find_seam and dog remove_seam tests before failing the dog_seam_carve test. Looking at the red channel vs correct red channel test, you can see we're only off in the first line of pixels. We've debugged it and looked at each pixel as it is copied pretty thoroughly and the incorrect first 134 comes in pretty late and we can't really tell why. We think it might have to do with how img is getting copied into our auxiliary smaller image because we noticed that the smaller matrix still had the same length of elements for a 5x5 (24 elements) but every 5th element has a long random number in it like it was not initialized (so it still has 19 "useful" elements and this is how many print out) which we do not understand since we initialized that small img matrix to be 4x5.</p>

-------------------------------------------------
<p>It's tricky to tell just by looking at it. I'd reccomend using your debugger to see what the values of the image channels are when you print it. Your Image_Print function could be going off the end of arrays. It's also possible that image_print is fine, but other image/matrix functions aren't working correctly. </p>

matrix_init in img
<p>I'm trying to initialize a Matrix in the img_init function but for some reason my parameter for the *mat isn't matching up- in the first parameter for the matrix_init function is it not just img?</p>

-------------------------------------------------
<p>If you look at the image struct in Image.h, there are 3 different matrices for each image representing each of the red, green, and blue color channels. In the Image_init function, you must initialize each of these three matrices using the Matrix_init function. You can access the channel matrices using the -&gt; operator on the image. Don't forget the Matrix_init function takes an address as the first parameter.</p>

<p>After copying the smaller matrix to the orginal matrix using *original = *smaller, is the Matrix_width value for the original matrix unchanged?</p>


<p>If so, is the smaller matrix initialized using width-1?</p>

-------------------------------------------------
<p>Yes, I used Image_init to initialize the smaller matrix with a width of img-&gt;width - 1</p>

find minimal vertical seam issue
<p>I cant for the life of me figure out why, but my find_minimal_vertical_seam function reaches out of bounds for its final column to put into the seam array. It works normally until row 0 where it then jumps from column 2 to column 0 (It is supposed to be 1 for the public test) which should not be possible.</p>

<p>It's not an out of bounds error or anything either, I have tested for that. If anyone has faced a similar problem help would be greatly appreciated.</p>

referencing the pointer
<p>Hi!</p>


<p></p>


<p>Here it says a value of type "const Matrix *" cannot be used to initialize an entity of type "Matrix *", and it seems like the const is the problem; but if I'm doing traversal by pointer, how else should I initialize the temporary ptr to match the starting address of the matrix being pointed to?</p>


<p><img alt="" height="155" src="/redirect/s3?bucket=uploads&amp;prefix=paste%2Fks5iojmc4rncc%2Fc368da9e919803bea8e5a17d453ba038a1aaca9550723d339d0065bdf153bb37%2FbuabuabuaAEHEHWE.png" width="1617"/></p>


<p>Also, if the const keyword is before Matrix instead of *, shouldn't it be holding the matrix behind the pointer const, not the pointer itself?</p>


<p></p>


<p>Thank you!</p>

<p>This might be a sign that you shouldn't be using traversal by pointer here. I would try using traversal by index with Matrix_at.</p>

find_minimal_vertical_seam how to initialize the seam array?
<p>I am failing the processing public test due to the fact that values are never added into my seam array. I get an error that I cannot have "variable length  array 'seam'". I understand why it is failing, but I am very lost on how to fix it if I cannot initialize the size of the array before calling the function. In other words, as I am debugging, my seam is always of the type (int*) and the values I am trying to pass into it are never added into the array at the indices I am trying to put them at. Not sure how to go about fixing this.</p>

-------------------------------------------------
<p>if you look at processing public tests.cpp, you will see that the seam array is already initialized with MAX Matrix height</p>


<p>because seam measures the height of Matrix cost.</p>

-------------------------------------------------
<p>Right, I see that, but I am still having the issue that my values are not being properly added to the array and I am getting the error that my seam array is of a variable length. So I am confused why this is happening when the array should have already been properly initialized before calling the function. </p>

-------------------------------------------------
<p>I also have the same issue? did you/someone get this resolved by chance?</p>

-------------------------------------------------
<p>I did! So basically I think the array wasn't showing because I didn't have the right values in it. I added cout statements in the function to print out seam[index] for each index, and values printed out correctly (meaning the array was working fine), they just were not the right values. I debugged the function, and once I had the right values printing out, I no longer had the above issue.</p>

Overwriting values in a Matrix with Matrix_at
<p>I am failing the test_image_from_and_to_stream test because for some reason I am printing the second row twice.</p>


<p>I used loops to fill in each item row by row in the initialization function.</p>


<p></p>


<p>If the matrix is starting out as say, <br/>0 0<br/>0 0</p>


<p></p>


<p>following the loops for the r, g, b, w pixels in the test I should get:</p>


<p>r g</p>


<p>0 0<br/><br/></p>


<p>after the first loop, and </p>


<p>r g</p>


<p>b w</p>


<p></p>


<p>after the second loop.</p>


<p></p>


<p>Instead, I get<br/>r g</p>


<p>r g</p>


<p></p>


<p>and then <br/>b w<br/>b w</p>


<p></p>


<p>I am not sure what could be causing this. It could be my matrix_at function which uses simple algebra, but I don't see how it could calculate the same pointer for different values of rows and columns. Otherwise, I don't know what could be wrong.</p>

-------------------------------------------------
<p>Without looking at your code, it looks like you are iterating through your Matrix_at too many times. I would use your debugger and step through your Image_init, and make sure you aren't accessing elements in your for loop more than you need to.</p>

Matrix false positive test cases
<p>My test functions for matrix_column_of_min_value_in_row and matrix_min_value_in_row are both getting detected as false positives and I'm not sure why. I've checked my test cases multiple times and I'm not sure why they're false positives.</p>

-------------------------------------------------
<p>From pulling up your autograder solution, here's your matrix:</p>


<p>[1, 2, 3]</p>


<p>[3, 16, 9]</p>


<p>[5, 11, 4]</p>


<p>[6, 13, 17]</p>


<p>[7, 12, 2]</p>


<p></p>


<p>For your first assertion:</p>


<p>ASSERT_EQUAL(Matrix_min_value_in_row(mat, 1, 1, 2), 9);</p>


<p>This looks for the min value in row 1 between column 1 (inclusive) &amp; column 2 (exclusive). Really, we are just returning whatever is in row 1, column 1, so we would expect the value to be 16, not 9.</p>


<p></p>


<p>I would pay attention to the RME for Matrix_min_value_in_row and Matrix_column_of_min_value_in_row since column end is <span style="text-decoration:underline">exclusive</span>, and update your implementation accordingly! </p>

What are some differences between running tests in the CAEN environment vs the autograder?
<p>Right now, when I run processing_public_tests.exe on the CAEN environment, my code runs perfectly with no issues. However, when I submit my code to the autograder, it shows that I my energy matrix is different from the computer matrix. I also want to note that I don't fail any other test cases other than the public_processing test cases, specifically the energy matrix. What are some reasons that could cause this difference in CAEN vs autograder? My uniqname is johnxie is any instructor wants to check the autograder for me.</p>

<p>Make sure to fill your energy matrix with zeros before you begin your calculation. The compiler will fill it with junk values which can mess up the call to Matrix_max at the very end.</p>

deep nesting
<p>Hi,</p>


<p>I wonder what is the standard of function being considered as deep nesting?</p>


<p>I have a function that has a structure like this:</p>


<p>for(...)</p>


<p>{</p>


<p>    for(...)</p>


<p>    {</p>


<p>        if</p>


<p>        else if</p>


<p>        else if</p>


<p>        else</p>


<p>    }</p>


<p>}.</p>


<p>would this be considered by the autograder as deep nesting?</p>


<p></p>

-------------------------------------------------
<p>This not considered deep nesting. It has to be &gt; 4 layers deep to cause an error on the autograder.</p>

-------------------------------------------------
<p>this is fine!</p>

<p>that’s ok since the maximum of nested layers in your code is 4, which equals to the maximum on Autograder.</p>

<p>The error I'm left with is Assertion failed: (0 &lt;= row &amp;&amp; row &lt; Matrix_height(mat)), function Matrix_at, file Matrix.cpp. I rechecked and compiled all other files again, but I did not touch them. Initially, everything worked and the cases were able to pass before this assertion began to fail. </p>


<p></p>


<p>Is there a way to fix this? </p>


<p></p>


<p>Thanks. </p>

<p>If you comment out the assertion and run your tests in a debugger you should be able to better troubleshoot the issue.</p>

Student Matrix Test
<p>On the autograder, it says there are false positives detected in 2 of my student matrix tests called "test_column_min_row_endpoint" and "test_min_row_endpoint". I am not sure why this is the case because the tests come back true when I run them using the command line. I get the expected output and my assert statement does not fail. I have attached my code for the test and the function if anyone is able to give me any clarification or guidance. Also to get a 10/10 for this section, does it mean we need to expose 10 bugs?</p>

output files
<p>So, for P2, will there be no .jpg or .png files? How can I get one?</p>

-------------------------------------------------
<p>Yeah, everything is inputted/outputted as a .ppm file. I think the quickest way to convert to .ppm to .jpg or .png would be to use an online file converter like CloudConvert.</p>

<p>Also in the specs of p2 there is a converting tool introduced(imagemagick)you can install it to do conversions to these pictures.</p>

compute_energy_matrix and compute_vertical_cost_matrix Question
<p>In the compute_energy_matrix function and the compute_vertical_cost_matrix function, do we have to set<br/>the width and height of energy and cost respectively? Or can we assume that energy and cost has already<br/>been initialized with the same dimensions as img and energy respectively?</p>

-------------------------------------------------
<p>No I believe you have to initialize them yourself, which should should be too difficult. I suggest using the functions you wrote in matrix.cpp to do so. </p>

XCode debugging resize.cpp
<p>Is there a way to use the debugger in XCode for resize.cpp (adding breakpoints and stepping through)? I only know how to run it in terminal and I can't get the debugger to work with terminal.</p>

-------------------------------------------------
<p>If you click to the left of any line number it will create a breakpoint there for you (should look like the picture). Clicking it again will disable the breakpoint (and you can right-click to delete it fully). Just run the program as you usually do and it will stop at the break point.</p>


<p><img alt="image.png" height="102" src="/redirect/s3?bucket=uploads&amp;prefix=paste%2Fl7axr4htifj405%2Fdf576bc886b3ef8420f7beb9672dee3536974679fea9b362108c8746d2ec3c9f%2Fimage.png" width="42"/></p>

-------------------------------------------------
<p>Thanks for your response. For me breakpoints only work when running in XCode but not when running in terminal. It's only possible to run resize.cpp in terminal right?</p>

-------------------------------------------------
<p>Sorry, forgot about the arguments. The XCode tutorial shows you how to do it (they use resize.cpp as an example too):</p>


<p></p>


<p>https://eecs280staff.github.io/p1-stats/setup_xcode.html#arguments-and-options</p>

-------------------------------------------------
<p>If you're still having problems with debugging, you can try using GDB. It's a command-line tool. This website helped me to get started with it: <a href="https://www.srcmake.com/home/cpp-debug-gdb" rel="noreferrer" target="_blank">https://www.srcmake.com/home/cpp-debug-gdb</a></p>


<p>You can call the setup with "file [code.exe]".</p>


<p>Once you've got it set up, you can type "break [function_name]" to add breakpoints, then type "run" and it will break on your breakpoints. If you want to view stackframes, you can type "up" or "down", and "p [variable]" will show you the value of a variable. "continue" will move to next breakpoint, and "next" will go line-by-line.</p>

-------------------------------------------------
<p>I'm entering into the terminal:</p>


<p></p>


<p>./resize.exe horses.ppm horses_400x250.ppm 400 250 --debug</p>


<p></p>


<p>and I have a breakpoint set in resize.cpp but it's not stopping there.</p>

Compue_energy_matrix problems
<p>Hi, I am trying to implement what I have written so far in the compute_energy_matrix function by running it through the processing public tests. However, it keeps failing because of an assertion failure related to image_set_pixel, but I am not sure why this is failing. I start the indexes at 1 and end them at height/width. I have pasted the error I get from the terminal, as well as what I have for the function so far. I can't seem to pinpoint the error. Any advice about this error or my code in general is greatly appreciated. </p>

-------------------------------------------------
<p>Well if you think about it, j's maximum value is going to be the index of the last column in the matrix. However, line 101 increments j to be 1 more than the last column, which is why you're getting your assertion error. Keep in mind line 99 has a similar problem, but with the row. </p>

Image_init errors
<p>I'm pretty stuck on my second Image_init function, and I don't know how to resolve the errors I have.

-------------------------------------------------
<p>It looks like you are trying to reference img-&gt;height[num] and img-&gt;width[num]. This is throwing an error because height and width is just an integer. The [] only work on arrays and vectors. You can find more information on img and it's attributes in the Image.h file.</p>

Processing.cpp - issue with remove vertical seam
<p>Our project is failing dog_seam_carve after passing the find seam and remove vertical seam test and our carved image is only slightly different from the correct one, which would make it seem like an off by one error perhaps but we have spent a lot of time debugging it and cannot find anything, everything seems to copy over fine from the image to the smaller image then we use pointers to copy the smaller image to the original image. Here is our code, we're pretty sure the issue is in remove vertical seam, but pretty stuck, could be something big we're doing wrong as well, who knows. Also posted question <a data-pats="post_ref" href="1098" onclick="return PE.gotoPost('1098');">@1098</a> which has more information on our test output<img alt="Screen_Shot_2022-09-26_at_11.01.29_AM.pngNaN" height="311" src="/redirect/s3?bucket=uploads&amp;prefix=paste%2Fkt3sinwk67y3nk%2F7c5c404cb8f3854b673a011cdaf0ec7e0e5660435d2a1f6370526c76561d632d%2FScreen_Shot_2022-09-26_at_11.01.29_AM.png" width="642"/></p>

-------------------------------------------------
<p>It looks like the error is originating in your compute_energy_matrix function. Based on the spec, we know that the border must always be 0. Looking at your code on the autograder, we have some undefined behavior. On the first iteration of the for loop, r = 0 and c = 0 so it will fail the first if statement. The computer will then go to the second if statement (Energy &gt; maxEnergy. At this point, energy hasn't been initialized to a value, resulting in undefined behavior. I would suggest creating a better way to fill the border with 0's.</p>

Matrix_at seems to break during Image code
<p>I noticed that my assertion for Matrix_at was failing during Image_public_tests, so I decided to open it in GDB and the results are extremely confusing to me. Image_set_pixel is called with correct row and column of 0, 0; but then Matrix_at (which is called directly with these values) seems to be calling on garbage values of 32767 and -134483968. Screenshot of GDB attached below. Not once in either of these functions do I modify row or column, why would this be referencing garbage values?</p>

Do we need to test Matrix_fill again if there's already the TEST(test_fill_basic)?

<p>Are there any parts of your main function that could be put into its own function? For instance, if there are 60 lines in your main and you copy-paste 30 of them into a different function, then you can just make the call in main to the other function you just created and save some lines. Remember that the style checker just checks to see that every function has less than 40 lines, it doesn't care about how many functions you make.</p>

Pointer Arithmetic in functions

<p>     dst++;<br/>  }</p>


<p>*dst = '\0'<br/>}</p>


<p></p>


<p>My question is, wouldn't incrementing str and dst through str++ and dst++ change the address of the first element that str and dst are pointing to permanently? or are *dst and *str passed in as copies of the arrays only?<br/><br/>(If so, would having void strcpy(&amp;char *dst, &amp;const char *src) change the addresses permanently?)</p>

<p>I want argc to store 400 to 0 and 250 to 1 and argv horses.ppm to 0 and horses_400x250.ppm to 1. Why is it not letting me do that?</p>

-------------------------------------------------
argc should be an integer value (not an array) containing the number of command line arguments and argv is an array of cstrings of all the command line arguments themselves. In your example, horses.ppm would be argv[1].

-------------------------------------------------
<p>In that case, how do I handle integer arguments (such as 400 and 250)? I would get an issue that a char* cannot be used to initialize an int</p>

-------------------------------------------------
<p>Like this:</p>


<p><img alt="image.pngNaN" height="350" src="/redirect/s3?bucket=uploads&amp;prefix=paste%2Fl7axr4htifj405%2F30925764c53d4deb7a24c338e12fea0fe7550829494412ccd62c93be7df77f05%2Fimage.png" width="459"/></p>


<p></p>


<p>So if 400 is the first argument it would be:<br/>int x = atoi(argv[1]);</p>

-------------------------------------------------
The numbers are read as cstrings. To turn them into ints, use the atoi function as described in lecture.

<p>Good point. I think I missed that when writing my function. I don't know how to make variable size arrays in C++.</p>

-------------------------------------------------
<p>im trying to make another array that i could copy the larger seam's data into, but the compiler wont let me initialize an array like this "int arr[Image_height(img)]"</p>

-------------------------------------------------
<p>We can dynamically allocate memory for an array in C++ like so: </p>


<pre><span class="hljs-keyword">int</span>* L = <span class="hljs-keyword">new</span> <span class="hljs-keyword">int</span>[size];

Problems after first row removal
<p>I have no problems removing a first seam, however my function fails when we try to remove the second seam. It says that it breaks an assert statement regarding the Matrix_at function's bounds. Does anyone have any ideas where the problem may be? </p>

-------------------------------------------------
<p>Could you provide more information? What lines inside your seam removal function is causing this and what assert statement is it failing (row or col out of bounds?). Once you've pinpointed this, you can check what row or column you are passing to Matrix_at and why it is out of bounds.</p>

processing.cpp dealing with small images
<p>I'm confused about how seam_carve should handle small matrices (sizes below 3x3). Should find/remove_seam always remove the leftmost column since the energy and cost matrices are only zeros? Furthermore, what should happen if there are no more columns to remove, like when remove_seam is run on a 1x1 matrix? </p>

-------------------------------------------------
<p>To answer the second part of your question, in the requires clause of remove_vertical_seam, the image has to be of width &gt;=2.</p>

-------------------------------------------------
<p>True, but if a small image is passed into remove_vertical_seam, is the program just supposed to output an assertion failure? I feel like its supposed to have a cleaner output maybe not though</p>

-------------------------------------------------
<p>We don't have to worry about what our programs do when a requires clause is broken.</p>

Seam wrong numbers
<p>For the first seam removed, my partner and I have the correct spots removed. However, when we try to remove the second seam our find_minimal_vertical_seam function gives us a bunch of weird values in the later rows for which column to remove. Is there a reason why this would randomly not work? </p>

-------------------------------------------------
<div class="markdown" id="q38kRj58oo0ooY"><p>This may be related to the question you asked at <a data-pats="post_ref" href="1161" onclick="return PE.gotoPost('1161');">@1161</a>. It sounds like somehow you’re reading values that you haven’t actually set, which might be if you are indexing out of bounds in your seam array or if you are attempting to access out-of-bounds data in a matrix / image. If this specific issue isn’t raising an assert failure, then I would say it’s likelier to be an issue with the seam array being indexed out of bounds.</p></div>

<p></p>


<p>everytime I run processing public test the first three tests pass and then the program just stops doing anything as if it were in an infinite loop somewhere.  We did not use any while loops so I am not sure how this could be happening.</p>

-------------------------------------------------
<p>While loops are not the only way you can have infinite loops in your program. Check to make sure you aren't accidentally calling any functions recursively and that your for loops actually terminate.</p>

-------------------------------------------------
<p>No functions are being called recursively. The test for dog says it passes then in autograder it still fails because it "times out". the other two just fail.</p>

-------------------------------------------------
<p>I would recommend using a visual debugger or going to office hours to try to find what is causing the infinite loop. The dog tests should be basically instantaneous.</p>

Starting Late on P2
<p>I'm starting super late on the project and I'm worried about not being able to finish in time. Is there any way I can optimize my time?</p>

-------------------------------------------------
I am not saying this to brag but I did it all last Tuesday, you should be ok. Do matrix.cpp first, then use the free tests to debug. Then do image.cpp, and use free tests to debug. Then write processing.cpp, test it, then write resize.cpp. Done! Try to use you submits sparingly!!!

-------------------------------------------------
<p>Like the student response mentions, tackle the files in this order: <code>matrix.cpp</code> -&gt; <code>image.cpp</code> -&gt; <code>processing.cpp</code> -&gt; <code>resize.cpp</code>. It’ll be especially helpful in <code>matrix.cpp</code> and <code>processing.cpp</code> to make sure you fully understand what the algorithms want you to compute before jumping straight into the code (I found that having a scrap paper next to me to draw out example matrices was really useful for visualizing things).</p>


<p></p>


<p>Write test cases for <code>matrix</code> and <code>image</code> if you need a break since those are a little more manual and require less big brain thinking. You got this, good luck!</p>

Remove vertical seam issues
<p>Hi, below I have pasted my implementation for remove_vertical_seam</p>


<p>The idea was to iterate through the image, and if the index stored in seam is equal to the current column, take the pixel AFTER the skipped one from the original image and add it to the new one. If the index stored in seam is not equal to the current column, just copy and paste the pixel from the original image. It complies and I do not get any indexing assertion error. I do get an assert failure because the correct image and the one produced by the algorithm are not equal. Any advice on what could be going wrong is greatly appreciated. <img alt="Screen_Shot_2022-09-26_at_4.26.39_PM.pngNaN" src="/redirect/s3?bucket=uploads&amp;prefix=paste%2Fkt0h8pe7gr356m%2Fdc842a0035bbcb85daa7bdfe301701ed8edc44f7b418c0584f6117d8a5a80c71%2FScreen_Shot_2022-09-26_at_4.26.39_PM.png"/></p>

-------------------------------------------------
<p>Let's say your image is 10x10 and in your current row, you want to skip column 4. Let us now say that j == 7. This means we would want to copy <strong>col 8 of our old image into col 7 of our new image.</strong> In your current code, since 7!=4, would go into the first if statement and copy <strong>col 7 of our old image into col 7 of our new image</strong>. You may want to look into separating your cases into before the removal col, and after the removal column instead.</p>

A question about the implementation of rotate_left function.
<p>This is the given implementation of rotate_left function.</p>

<p></p>


<p>In this implementation, a new auxiliary image is created and the new rotated image is stored into it. Then we need to copy data into original.</p>


<p></p>


<p>When copying data back into original, why it is implemented in such way? To my understanding, the memory diagram  should be like, there are two image objects in the dynamic allocated memory. Before copying back, <strong><kbd>img</kbd></strong> is pointed to the original image object and <strong><kbd>aux</kbd></strong> is pointed to the new rotated image. Therefore, we need to first delete the original image object in the dynamic memory, then let <kbd><strong>img</strong></kbd> points to the new rotated image. So to my understanding this implementation should be like this:</p>


<pre><span class="hljs-keyword">delete</span> img; <span class="hljs-comment">// delete the original image object in the dynamic memory</span>

<p>Beware, many online converters convert the image to a "P6" .ppm format. This is different than the "P3" format we are using in our program. You can tell the difference because the first line of the file is either "P6" or "P3". I used this online converter to convert the P6 files to P3 files to use with my program:</p>

<p>I'm just wondering if we should be altering this line in any way, like for example if the error is that they gave the wrong number of arguments, should we still inform them that WIDTH and HEIGHT must be less than or equal to original? Since this is not really the error they're running into.</p>

Why is autograder giving me this error?
<p>I don't understand why I have this error as there is literally a member variable int width in Image.<img alt="Screen_Shot_2022-09-26_at_5.33.36_PM.pngNaN" src="/redirect/s3?bucket=uploads&amp;prefix=paste%2Fkt02wxxzym346%2F1d3c7e35ab1000bbb8272cf379061be24dcab975ba09f7de112baba6c6b4b536%2FScreen_Shot_2022-09-26_at_5.33.36_PM.png"/></p>

-------------------------------------------------
<p>The error you are receiving here has to do with the fact that you are not respecting the interfaces.</p>


<p>You should not be directly accessing the data held by your image struct using the -&gt; operator in your processing.cpp file. Instead, you should use the functions you wrote to access this data (Image_width, Image_height, Image_get_pixel, etc).</p>


<p></p>


<p>Please read the "Respect the interfaces!" section of the project spec. </p>


<p><a href="https://eecs280staff.github.io/p2-cv/#interface-1" rel="noreferrer" target="_blank">https://eecs280staff.github.io/p2-cv/#interface-1</a></p>

-------------------------------------------------
<p>Is there any way to remove the width by one pixel whilst respecting the interfaces? img_width is a const so it doesn't allow changes to it.</p>

-------------------------------------------------
<p>Yes! You can create a temporary image, initialize it with width-1, use a for loop to copy all the pixels except the seam from img to the temp, then write *img = *temp to set the previous image equal to the new, smaller image. Don't forget to delete the temp image when you're done with it to avoid memory leaks.</p>

respecting interface while copying new_img to img in remove_vertical_seam()
<p>Hi,</p>


<p></p>


<p>for remove_vertical_seam(), after creating and filling up new_img as my new image with the seam removed, I have 2 options for how to copy this new_img back to img:</p>


<p></p>


<p>1:</p>


<div>
<div>Image_init(img, width-1, height);</div>
<br/>
<div>for(int i=0;i&lt;height;i++){</div>
<div>for(int j=0;j&lt;width-1;j++){</div>
<div>Pixel p=Image_get_pixel(new_img, i, j);</div>
<div>Image_set_pixel(img, i, j, p);</div>
<div>}</div>
<div>}</div>
<div>delete new_img;</div>
<div></div>
</div>


<div>2:
<div>
<div>*img = *new_img;</div>
<div>delete new_img;</div>
<div></div>
</div>
</div>


<div>Both of these seem to work fine. I was just wondering, are both options okay in terms of respecting the interface and address sanitizer (i.e. memory leaks)?</div>



<div>Thanks,</div>

test rotate processing public tests
<p>my test rotate function is failing. wasn't rotate a built in function? how is this failing?</p>

-------------------------------------------------
<p>The rotate functions use student written functions from Image.cpp. If those are not working properly, the rotate function won't work properly as well.</p>

-------------------------------------------------
<p>Adding onto the student's response.</p>


<p></p>


<p>In particular, I would take a look at Image_width, Image_height, Image_init, Image_set_pixel, and Image_get_pixel, as these are called upon by the rotate functions which are provided to you.</p>

-------------------------------------------------
<p>i had the same error for my matrix tests. it means you're going out of bounds somewhere in your resize file, for example, in terms of indexing, which is probably the most probable cause for this</p>

-------------------------------------------------
<p>As the student's answer suggests, a segmentation fault is likely the result of attempting to index out-of-bounds on a matrix. Many of the functions you implement in processing.cpp contain edge cases where you will want to be extra careful that you do not attempt to access something at an invalid index.</p>

-------------------------------------------------
<p>Are you calling resize without any additional command line arguments eg</p>


<pre>./resize.exe file_in.ppm file_out.ppm 4 5</pre>
<p></p>


<p>You may be indexing out of bounds if you tried to get the filenames (ex: argv[2]) when you just called ./resize.exe since argc == 1. Make sure you check the length of argv before attempting to get any of the filenames or new width/heights</p>

</div>



<div>So this is what we have for our Image_print function (we are trying to match the public test case right now) and we have an idea on how to match the print format needed, but we are struggling with the syntax. The bolded line is the line that is giving us the issue, and is also the line that we are using to print in the proper format. We have looked into modifying lvalues and how it is not possible, but we aren't sure of how to go about writing this in a way that doesn't give us syntax errors. Thank you.</div>

-------------------------------------------------
<p>You know when you exit the inner for loop, you have reached the end of a line. What can you then print before the outer for loop iterates? Similarly, after your exit the both for loops, you know you have printed the entire image. What can you print to match the format.</p>

-------------------------------------------------
<p>So the format that we are looking for looks something like this:</p>


<div>
<div>"P3\n2 2\n255\n255 0 0 0 255 0 \n0 0 255 255 255 255 \n";</div>
</div>


<p>What we had beforehand is something like this:</p>


<div>
<div>"P3\n2 2\n255\n255 0 0 \n0 255 0 \n0 0 255 \n255 255 255 \n";</div>
</div>


<p></p>


<p>So in ours, we had 2 extra lines, which we are trying to remove. We are trying to print two sets of numbers (so 6 numbers), end the line, and then print another 2 sets of numbers (also 6), then end the line. Sorry, I'm not quite sure if I completely understand the suggestion that you made...</p>

<p></p>


<p>It's the same idea except instead of printing one element of a single array, you can print the three pixels like you are now</p>

Respecting interface in resize.cpp
<p>When I create an image object in resize.cpp, can I just do img.width and img.height? or should I be calling Image_Height(&amp;img) and Image_width(&amp;img)? Do we get graded for respecting the interface in resize.cpp? thanks</p>

-------------------------------------------------
<p>Accessing the image data directly using .width is not respecting the interface. You should be calling Image_width.</p>


<div>I am almost positive we are graded on respecting the interface in resize.cpp.</div>


<div>Regardless, accessing data members directly when outside of the interface is considered very bad practice and you should always call the member functions.</div>

Matrix_tests.exe and autograder
<p>Hello!</p>


<p>So I have an error where my matrix_tests file compiles and completely passes. But when I put it in the autograder, I get an issue with my Matrix_column_of_min_value_in_row tests. I had an issue with my Matrix_print function but I fixed that. So I synced my code to caen but I can't really seem to know where the problem is occuring because like I said, my code works without any issues and therefore I can't really use the debugger. On caen, the issue (i think) is that it returns an address rather than the column value. However, my other tests worked perfectly fine and only 2 of them are experiencing this issue. I've attached a pic of my view where my code works fine, and then the caen system failed assertions.<br/><br/><img alt="image.png" height="416" src="/redirect/s3?bucket=uploads&amp;prefix=paste%2Fkehxpvrzm1j4sh%2Fcea1193f6a8317d153d79d10563579269b42111121ba0a571a5978516ea558a6%2Fimage.png" width="339"/></p>

<p>In your current implementation, what would happen if the min value were at column_start? As a reminder, values that are uninitialized will hold some junk value and can lead to undefined behavior if you try to do something with that value. </p>

-------------------------------------------------
<p>So would setting min equal to *start not work as initializing the variable to be the first number within the Matrix?</p>

-------------------------------------------------
<p>That works for setting the min, but keep in mind that you are returning <kbd>col</kbd></p>

-------------------------------------------------
<p>As a follow up, what would happen in the first iteration of your loop on line 196? The first time around, ptr would be equal to start, and min = *start. What would <kbd>*ptr &lt; min</kbd> evaluate to?</p>

-------------------------------------------------
<p>ahhh okok thank you!! I just had to initialize column to column_start. :)</p>

<p></p>


<p>Hello! I am trying to write the source code for the remove_vertical_seam function, but I'm a bit confused on what the Project spec is actually saying. Are we creating a new PPM stream and then creating an image based on that new stream of data? Or are we shifting the whole image after reaching the seam (the orange part)? Some clarification would definitely help!</p>


<p></p>

-------------------------------------------------
<p>We are removing the seam and shifting the rest of the image after reaching the seam to fill that empty space.</p>


<p></p>


<p>The way I did it was by creating a new image and copying over the old image (except the seam) then setting the old image equal to the new image.</p>


<p></p>

-------------------------------------------------
<p>I did this however the width of my img did not change. I still need to chop off the last column somehow.</p>

-------------------------------------------------
<p>Did you initialize the smaller image with a width = Image_width(original_image) - 1? And did you copy the contents of the smaller image to the original image by using *original_image = *smaller_image?</p>

-------------------------------------------------
<p>First of all, this is a void function. Void functions do not return anything. </p>


<p>In your function, seting red, green, and blue to cred, creen, and crue does nothing because the red, green, and blue variables are never used again.</p>


<p>Also, the Image_get_pixel function returns a pixel, not a *pixel. </p>


<p></p>


<p>For each image, there are three matrixes: red_channel, green_channel, and blue_channel.</p>


<p>I think to implement this function, you should use the Matrix_at function with the given row and column on each of these matrices and set the value of the matrix to the corresponding r g or b value of the color pixel.</p>

If yes, then to input the matrix from the ppm file. can I use the Pixel struct to seperate each of the pixels from the groups of 3 given in each row and then input them somehow in the image struct.

In resize.cpp image and matrix functions don't work

<p>I'm working on resize.cpp right now, but when I try to make a new image or use image functions, I get the following error: Unknown type name 'Image'. This error went away when I used #include "processing.h" in the header, but since that was not there originally, I'm not sure if it's allowed or will cause any problems.</p>

DEADLYSIGNAL
<p>Hi!</p>


<p></p>


<p>After running Image_tests, I had a really ominous looking error showing up in the address sanitizer. Upon inspection, I think I might have done something wrong in my set_pixel, but I really can't figure out what it is. It seems like an out of bounds issue, but I can't tell where is it that the memory is going crazy. </p>

<p>You're probably writing to memory somewhere that hasn't been initialized. I'd take a look at the functions that initialize things: Image_Init, Matrix_Init, and also look at Matrix_at.</p>

Segmentation Fault in Remove Vertical Seam
<p>Hello. My partner and I are getting a segmentation fault error whenever we run our program and the debugger shows that it is occurring after we remove vertical seam, and it tries to set the pixel for the blue channel.

How do I test matrix_row and matrix_column
<p>Hi i am getting some problems about testing matrix_column, I try to write my test cases with the format of the free test case in Matrix_test.cpp, but in order to test it, I need a ptr as my input, do I call matrix_at to get the ptr??? but when i write the matrix_at function i have already known the column and row...which is kind of weird...</p>

-------------------------------------------------
<p>You should be creating and deleting a matrix for each test you have with 'new' and 'delete'. Even though it seems redundant, you should still test the row and column functionality that way.</p>

question about assumptions for RME clauses
<p>can we assume that the input will always be in proper PPM format for Image_init?</p>

-------------------------------------------------
<p>In the requires clause for Image_init it says "is contains an image in PPM format without comments (any kind of whitespace is ok)"</p>


<p></p>


<p>Does this answer your question?</p>


<p></p>


<p>We will not be tested on input that violates the requires clause.</p>

-------------------------------------------------
<p>so then do all of these count?</p>


<p>regular white space: " "</p>


<p>tab: "\t"</p>


<p>newline: "\n"</p>

<p>are there any I am missing?</p>

-------------------------------------------------
<p>Yes this is all valid as part of the input. I can't think of any others you are missing.</p>


<p></p>


<p>If you just treat the input stream for Image_init as if it were cin, the whitespace is skipped automatically.</p>

Seam_carve functions
<p>Can someone explain how to approach the seam_carve_width, seam_carve_height, and seam_carve functions? I know we have to call all the functions listed on the specs but I'm confused about the creating matrix objects part. </p>

-------------------------------------------------
<p>For seam_carve_width, I used a while loop in order to keep carving until the width was equal to the newWidth. Outside of the loop, I created two new matrices: the energy and cost matrices. Inside of the loop, I initialized and computed the energy matrix, initialized and computed the cost matrix, then initialized (with max height see <a href="https://piazza.com/class/l7548zpfvr8yj?cid=768" rel="noreferrer" target="_blank"></a><a data-pats="post_ref" href="768" onclick="return PE.gotoPost('768');">@768</a>), found, and removed the seam using each of the functions we previously created in processing. </p>


<p></p>


<p>For seam_carve_height, I rotated the img to the left, called seam_carve_width, and rotated it back. </p>


<p></p>


<p>For seam_carve, I called seam_carve_width and then seam_carve_height.</p>

-------------------------------------------------
<p>should we be deleting the energy and cost matrices at the end of the while loop or can it get reinitialized each time the loop iterates without being deleted first? in which case we would put the call for delete at the very end of the function, right?</p>

Carve width works but carve height doesnt
<p>For the test cases for crabster, it seems that the printed values are correct for the ones that have changing values in the widthsize</p>


<p>but same value in height. However, when I try to change both like in the test case for crabster 70x35, the printed values are wrong.</p>


<p></p>


<p>Why is that when the functions do the same thing and the height is just turned width?</p>

-------------------------------------------------
<p>For carving the height, you have to rotate the image, carve, and rotate back. Can't give more detail</p>

Width heap buffer overflow
<p>I'm having trouble debugging a heap buffer overflow error when I run the matrix public tests -- specifically when testing Matrix_max in test_matrix_basic -- because it's redirecting me to Matrix_width.

remove_vertical_seam always removing last column
<p>My remove_vertical_seam function is only ever removing the last column of an image. Currently, I have it set up as an if function where if the column number &lt; the seam column number, it copies the pixel from img into the smaller image, and if the column number &gt; the seam column number, it copies the pixel over. Is there an obvious problem in my logic? I've tried debugging and it always appears that it's only copying over the correct values but my _removed.out.ppm shows that it is only removing the last column.</p>

-------------------------------------------------
<p>I used this exact same logic in my program and it worked well.</p>


<p>How are you copying the pixels to the smaller image/ the smaller image to the original image at the end of the function?</p>

-------------------------------------------------
<div class="markdown" id="q38kRj58oo0ooY"><p>Splitting the pixel copying action logically between col&lt;seam and col&gt;seam seems appropriate, but make sure that when it’s “copying the pixel over”, it puts each input pixel in the output image, but moved to the left by 1—that is, if <code>seam[2] == 3</code>, for example, then the input pixel at row 2, column 5 should be written to row 2, column 4 in the output image.</p></div>

-------------------------------------------------
<p>To copy the original image into the smaller image, I'm doing Image_set_pixel(smallImg, row, column, Image_get_pixel(img, row, column)); where smallImg is the new smaller image. At the end to copy the smaller image back onto the original, I do *img = *smallImg. </p>

-------------------------------------------------
<p>This is exactly what I did. I am stumped.</p>

-------------------------------------------------
<p>Just figured it out, thank you for helping me narrow down the problem. I think the problem was when I was copying over the columns that are greater than the seam column number, I was leaving the column that i was supposed to be skipping blank. For the columns greater than the seam, I had to change the code to  Image_set_pixel(smallImg, row, column - 1, Image_get_pixel(img, row, column));</p>

-------------------------------------------------
<p>Of course! I should have thought to mention that. That was a tricky one for me too.</p>

-------------------------------------------------
<p>It looks like somewhere the test case you've written is causing errors (is it indexing out of bounds or going into unallowed memory?), which is causing the "false positive" result on Autograder. Debugging is definitely the right approach to fixing this! Try placing some breakpoints earlier in your code and walking through, line by line, until you find where your test case is crashing.</p>

However, my issue with this TEST is that I can't place breakpoints within it. I even tried commenting out everything within the TEST itself and I ran into an error.
The error occurs stepping from and running the line the test declaration (TEST(column…)) to the next line. TEST itself causes an error. I can not add breakpoints within this one test case.</p></div>

-------------------------------------------------
<div class="markdown" id="q38kRj58oo1ooY"><p>Have you been recompiling your code each time before trying the debugger?</p></div>

-------------------------------------------------
<p>Does false positive mean it's actually your test cases are wrong but probably not your corresponding function in .cpp is wrong? because I have a similar problem that all of my test cases get a pass except one of the TEST(column_of_min_value_in_row), it returns one less than what it should be, but all of others test cases are fine, which is super weird, thus making me think is it possible that it's my test case wrong...</p>

Things about matrix we should know for this project
<p>Hi, I didn't take eecs 183 here. So, I didn't learn about the matrix. So, I found it difficult to start the project. What should I know about matrix in order to do this project? Thank you so much!</p>

-------------------------------------------------
go to matrix.h to see. They are not black-boxy at all, they are very direct, and nothing makes them special, they are just a struct.

-------------------------------------------------
<p>Matrix.h has comments that describe the Matrix struct more and how we expect the Matrix functions to work. Matrix is just a struct with 3 attributes: width, height, and a data array. We can think of a matrix as an nxm structure, but we implement it in code as a 1D array that would have length nxm. </p>

Get_pixel: unsure how to return a pixel? Set_pixel: confused as to the difference in code?
<p>Hihi, </p>


<p></p>


<p>I've been digging through multiple Piazza posts on the topic and wanted to reach out for specific help. As I'm working on the Image.cpp file, I have encountered an obvious issue where my code for the image_get_pixel and image_set_pixel function are relatively the same. The only difference I understand is having to return a pixel (which I'm struggling to figure out) and returning nothing with the void function. I know the question may seem vague, but I would appreciate some clarification and potential guidance on this. I have attached my code for the two functions below. Thank you!</p>

<p>You have the right idea in the Image_get_pixel function as it is supposed to just access the Matrix channels of the image and return the values in a Pixel struct. You just have to return the Pixel object you create and not the general "Pixel" data type.</p>


<p></p>


<p>For Image_set_pixel, you do not return anything as the goal is to again index into the Matrix channels of the image, and this time set the three matrices at the given row and column with the given pixel. You do not need to call Image_get_pixel in there as you are given the Pixel you are setting the color channels to via the "Pixel color" parameter. Using this parameter, access the color channel matrices at the given row/col and set each one to the corresponding value of the color parameter.</p>

Seam_carve not working for crabster and horses but passing everything else.

P3 Matrix.cpp Code compiles but fails basic and print tests
<p>What exactly does the segmentation fault error mean for the print function and how can I fix the Basic test to pass.</p>

<p></p>

-------------------------------------------------
<p>Segfaults are caused by a program trying to read or write an illegal memory location. In practice, segfaults are almost always due to trying to read or write a non-existent array element, not properly defining a pointer before using it, or (in C programs) accidentally using a variable's value as an address.</p>

Confused about the min_column function test result
<p>Hi i catch a bug with my test cases but i am not quite sure what's going on...</p>

-------------------------------------------------
<p>I believe the error output is giving you the line number of where the error is occurring in the matrix_tests file. For example, on line 176 you are trying to assert that 1 == 2, and that's why it's failing. This means your matrix_column_min_value_in_row function isn't returning the correct result. </p>

-------------------------------------------------
<p>Sorry I should be more specific, my problem is kind of weird, my function passed all of my test cases but one of them, when i pick a small area in my big matrix and the smallest element is at the end column, it returns one less than what it should be...</p>

Integer Overload?
I looked up online on how to access this error, but don't want to violate the "Respect the interface" rule by adding in data types that would help me understand this. I guess the arithmetic I performed was ran through the auto-grader and they passed in huge values that an "int" is not big enough to store. But my only question is how could they pass that in when we have a const variable set a maximum number so values that big are never passed in?
<br/>
UMID: 06674564, to look at my code.
<br/>
<br/>
The error is said to be on lines 120 and 131 in Matrix.cpp. (AKA in functions Matrix_fill() and const int Matrix_at(), the arithmetic/math particularly)

Edge Test Case for Matrix_fill_border
<p>Hi,</p>


<p>I wrote an edge test case for Matrix_fill_border with a 1x1 matrix. I was wondering if this is an ok test case to submit because while Matrix_fill_border does not have any requirements for row and column size, it calls Matrix_at, which does. This test case fails the requires clause for Matrix_at, so I am basically wondering if this is ok since I am not testing Matrix_at (since we are not supposed to write cases for required prohibited).</p>


<p></p>


<p>Also, if this test case is ok, my code stops running there because it fails my assertions in Matrix_at. Is there anything that I need to do about this or will the rest of my cases also not run on autograder?</p>


<p></p>


<p>Thanks for your help!</p>

atoi/stoi error for resize on autograder
<p>confused on this error i'm getting from the autograder:</p>


<p></p>


<p>terminate called after throwing an instance of 'std::invalid_argument'</p>


<p>what(): stoi</p>


<p></p>


<p>in my resize.cpp function i #included &lt;cstdlib&gt; and only ever used atoi, not stoi, so i don't understand why i'm getting this error.</p>


<p></p>


<p>is there something else i should be including? any help would be appreciated :)</p>

-------------------------------------------------
<div class="markdown" id="q38kRj58oo0ooY"><p>It seems like it doesn’t like the argument you’re passing into the function parenthesis. Confirm that you are giving it one c-string. It should be in the format:
int num = std::atoi( argv[#] );</p>
<p>argv[#] is the c-string from the command line, which becomes a number as is given to the num integer.</p>
<p>Hope this helps.</p></div>

-------------------------------------------------
<p>i'm having a similar problem with my code, i first initialized a string variable to be argv[3], and then called the stoi function.</p>


<p></p>


<p>like this:</p>

<div>
<div>string w = argv[3];</div>
<div>int width = stoi(w);</div>
</div>



<div>i'm getting the same error, and i'm not sure what's wrong with my code. do you have any suggestions?</div>

-------------------------------------------------
<p>I don't see why you are creating a separate string to store argv[3] instead of just calling stoi(argv[3]). I don't know if this will fix the error but it is worth a shot.</p>

-------------------------------------------------
<p>i tried calling stoi(argv[3]) at first but it gave me the same error so i changed it. i thought it might be something with my IDE but it's throwing the same error in the autograder so I'm not sure</p>

-------------------------------------------------
<p>I wonder if you wrote std::stoi() it would work. It might have to do witht the fact that you aren't using namespace std.</p>

-------------------------------------------------
<p>i am using namespace std, and when i commented out all of my calls to stoi and tried to print out the value of argv[3] to see if it was incorrect, i still got the same error</p>

resize.cpp
<p>In resize.cpp after we call argc and argv in the parameters of main, I'm confused on how we write input/out fstreams?</p>

-------------------------------------------------
<p>Once you declare your ifstream variable, you can open the file you want to read from using .open(filename) on your ifstream variable where filename is the second command line argument argv[1]. Once you are done reading the file using the ifstream similar to how you would use a cin stream, close the file using .close() on your ifstream variable.</p>

<p>ofstream works the same way as ifstream but for output.</p>

no instance of overloaded function "Matrix_at" matches the argument list
<p>My code gives me this error when I pass in channel matrixes to the Matrix_at function in image.cpp. I've tried just giving img-&gt;[color]_channel to the parameter(+ row, column) and declaring a separate const variable that just points at img-&gt;[color]_channel and then pass it onto the parameter, but it still seems to fail with the same reason. What seems to be the issue here?</p>

-------------------------------------------------
<p>Matrix_at calls for a Matrix pointer. img-&gt;[color]_channel is just a Matrix. This means you will have to send the address of img-&gt;[color]_channel to the function by using the &amp; operator.</p>

-------------------------------------------------
<p>this error is telling you you're trying to write to undefined memory, and gives you some hints of where this may be happening: look at processing.cpp line 191 &amp; 271, and resize.cpp line 69</p>

Uninitialized array
<p>Should we be initializing all the array values  to 0? If so, when should we do it? (what function)</p>


<p></p>


<p>For example, if we had a 2 x 2 matrix, but didn't initialize several points, they would all be random numbers, right?</p>

-------------------------------------------------
<p>You should not have to initialize all the array values to 0.</p>

-------------------------------------------------
<p>They could be all random numbers, they could be all zeros. You should initialize your matrix to a value as safe practice.</p>

-------------------------------------------------
<p>Then if we want to have one that becomes {0, 0, 1, 0}, we have to manually edit all four values instead of just the third one(?)</p>

<p>This happens if I #include Matrix.h, Image.h, or processing.h, and my current implementation requires the latter two of those to work. I'm on VScode on Windows 10. Anyone have any ideas on how to fix this? </p>


<p></p>


<p>Edit 1: Forgot to mention in the question body that this is for #including these into resize.cpp.</p>


<p></p>


<p>Thanks in advance</p>


<p></p>


<p>Edit 2: Just figured it out! The #include for these needs to be written as #include"Matrix.h", not #include&lt;Matrix.h&gt;, which I had been doing. Silly mistake. Oh well</p>

-------------------------------------------------
<p>I'm not sure if this will fix your problem but since processing.h includes both Matrix.h and Image.h you only need to include that in your resize.cpp. You also want to make sure all of your files are in the same directory.</p>

Approaches for testing Matrix_print
<p>Hi! My partner and I are wondering how to test Matrix_print. Do we just set whatever the os is outputting to the expected string of values?</p>


<p></p>


<p></p>

-------------------------------------------------
<p>You can pass the Matrix_print function an ostringstream as its output stream and then use .str() to compare it to the correct output string. </p>


<p></p>


<p>Here are the lecture notes for more information on stringstreams:</p>

Matrix_column_of_min_value_in_row
<p>Hello, I would just like some explanation on why the code doesn't work or why my temp variable doesn't update because I think that's what's causing the problem.  When testing my matrix functions, I found out that when my 1st variable is larger than the rest, it messes up my column function since I didn't include the temp = *Matrix_at(mat, row, col); inside my loop so if the other numbers were less than my starting temp, it would always update joy, giving me the wrong output.  However, I thought I fixed it by also updating temp whenever there is a value that's smaller than the original, but it still doesn't work.  Why is that?  Is temp not getting updated?  </p>

Matrix_at goes out of bounds in Image_set_pixel
<p>When I call Matrix_at in any of my tests for Matrix.cpp, there never seems to be an issue. However, when I call it in Image_set_pixel, I get this error:</p>


<p><img alt="Screen_Shot_2022-09-27_at_12.08.55_AM.png" src="/redirect/s3?bucket=uploads&amp;prefix=paste%2Fky38qkcln1s3mz%2F57c99fdc0d85711f3fb8c83ce0f3aacd1108407edf69477f919d476c6e468891%2FScreen_Shot_2022-09-27_at_12.08.55_AM.png"/></p>


<p></p>


<p>And it specifically highlights Matrix_at, which would lead me to believe that this is the issue. Our implementation of this function is very simple, and we've had no issue with it in the past, so I'm not sure how I would go about fixing this problem. Any suggestions?</p>


<p></p>

-------------------------------------------------
<p>What change did you make directly before seeing this error? It's possible that your Matrix_at function is working fine, but another function elsewhere in your code is passing in buggy rows and columns. This is also likely since we see that the index -1094795586 is being accessed (which for me is a common default value for uninitialized integers in memory). Check your functions elsewhere that call this function to make sure they aren't passing in an undefined number.</p>


<p></p>


<p>Hope this helps.</p>

-------------------------------------------------
<div class="markdown" id="q38kRj58oo0ooY"><p>The students’ answer describes the general approach for these out-of-bounds situations pretty well, but if you’re seeing this exclusively for <code>Image_set_pixel</code>, maybe you didn’t set the width and height of the image <em>and its channel matrices</em> properly when initializing it.</p></div>

Autograder Problems

<p>This is with tiny functions such as the assertion on Matrix_height() fails in the middle of a different test on the autograder.</p>

-------------------------------------------------
<p>Usually when code has different output when run on different machines, there is some sort of undefined behavior. I would recommend running and debugging your code on the CAEN system because it is a similar environment to the autograder.</p>

UB check problem and double free or corruption problem
<p>In autograder, there is a problem shown in autograder called corruption or double free in the matrix_test. We are confused about why this problem occurred. It looks like this: </p>


<p>*** Error in `./Matrix_tests.exe': double free or corruption (out): 0x0000000000c853c0 ***</p>


<p></p>


<p>Also, we have another problem in UB check in matrix_test and already delete all the new matrix created. It looks like this: </p>


<p>==91==ERROR: AddressSanitizer: heap-buffer-overflow on address 0x7faea0207a48 at pc 0x000000426be6 bp 0x7ffd60cc8780 sp 0x7ffd60cc8770</p>


<p></p>


<p>Thank you so much for your help and time! </p>

-------------------------------------------------
<div class="markdown" id="q38kRj58oo0ooY"><p><code>heap-buffer-overflow</code> typically means your program is trying to access heap memory beyond the end of a chunk of heap memory that it owns. Take a closer look at the address sanitizer’s error (from the submission timestamped at 9:26 PM)—the first lines include a stack trace taken at the instant the illegal memory access occurred. Line 4 ends in “Matrix.cpp:23”, so it tells you that line 23 in Matrix.cpp caused the illegal memory access. How could that line have led your program to access memory past the end of a chunk it owns?</p>
<p>By comparing the program’s output during the UB check and that during the double-free/corruption test run, you can tell that both errors happened inside the same test case, so they are probably related. By fixing the UB problem, you will probably fix the double-free/corruption error as well.</p></div>

Autograder Problems with assertions

Matrix_row problem
<p>For Matrix_row, our thought process behind this was to find the distance between the pointer given and mat-&gt;data. Then, to find the row, we did the distance / mat-&gt;width. We are passing the public tests for Matrix_row, but not our own personal tests, and we can't seem to pinpoint the issue using the debugger. Any thoughts on what could be the issue?</p>

-------------------------------------------------
so by default any number on its own is an integer so when you divide the distance by width, whatever number you get is always rounded down, that number will only work in certain cases and not all, so you need a way to fix that.

-------------------------------------------------
<div class="markdown" id="q38kRj58oo0ooY"><p>According to your autograder submission from the time, you mixed up the row and height numbers between <code>Matrix_init</code> and <code>Matrix_at</code> in your test. By calling <code>Matrix_init(mat, 3, 4)</code>, you initialized <code>mat</code> to have a <em>width of 3</em> and a <em>height of 4</em>. This means it has 3 <em>columns</em> and 4 <em>rows</em>, so the valid columns are 0, 1, 2, while the valid rows are 0, 1, 2, 3.</p>
<p>Then, you did <code>Matrix_at(mat, 0, 3)</code>, which takes row 0 and column 3. <code>mat</code> does not have a column 3 (only 0, 1, and 2), so the 3 was out-of-bounds.</p>
<p>Long story short, the ordering of the parameters in <code>Matrix_init</code> and <code>Matrix_at</code> are effectively swapped. For some <code>Matrix_init(mat, x, y)</code>, <code>Matrix_at(mat, a, b)</code> must satisfy <code>a &lt; y</code> and <code>b &lt; x</code>.</p></div>

<p>Is there a hint? Thank you so much!</p>

Some errors I'm having

Also, I'm not sure my pointer for loop is working properly, I am aware that I can't use regular ints like width and height, but what do I use instead? Also, do I index the pointer at 0? Thanks.</p>

-------------------------------------------------
<p>For your pointer for loop, remember that you can use pointer arithemetic to help you here. Your pointer should start by pointing to an address in memory that you want to start looking at, not the value 0. For example, if you wanted to start your loop at index (2, 3), you would have a pointer pointing to that element. </p>


<p>If you wanted your loop to end at index (2, 5), you'd want to go until your pointer is less than the address of that index. More information here: <a href="https://eecs280staff.github.io/notes/04_Arrays.html#array-indexing" rel="noreferrer" target="_blank">https://eecs280staff.github.io/notes/04_Arrays.html#array-indexing</a> I'd check out the traversal by pointer section!</p>


<p>For your image errors, it looks like you're setting image-&gt;red_channel.data(which is an array of ints) to a single integer, which is where the error comes from. You'll need to set a specific element in the matrix to that value. (I'd reccomend using your matrix_at function!)</p>

<p>Error given:</p>


<p>False positives detected in 1 of your tests. Those tests reported an error when run against a correct implementation.</p>

-------------------------------------------------
This means that the tests you wrote are being run on an implementation that the professors have designated as completely correct. A false positive means that your code is reporting a bug where one does not exist. So far for me that has always meant that my test code had an issue in it.

initializing seam
<p>Working on seam_carve_width. I was wondering how to initialize a seam variable to pass into the find_minimal_vertical_seam function.</p>

-------------------------------------------------
According to
<a href="https://piazza.com/class/l7548zpfvr8yj?cid=768" rel="noreferrer" target="_blank"></a>
<a data-pats="post_ref" href="768" onclick="return PE.gotoPost('768');">@768</a>
, you should just initialize the seam with the maximum value. However, this violates one of the function's required clauses.
<div>If you wish to follow the required clause, you can use the solution I found here: <a href="https://piazza.com/class/l7548zpfvr8yj?cid=1158" rel="noreferrer" target="_blank"></a><a href="https://piazza.com/class/l7548zpfvr8yj?cid=1158" rel="noreferrer" target="_blank"></a><a data-pats="post_ref" href="1158" onclick="return PE.gotoPost('1158');">@1158</a></div>
<div><br/></div>

-------------------------------------------------
<p>How do I call this in the function?</p>

-------------------------------------------------
You should just initialize seam in seam_carve_width like so: int seam[MAX_MATRIX_HEIGHT]
<div><br/></div>
<div>The pass that to find_minimal_vertical_seam.</div>

-------------------------------------------------
<p>and how do I initialize seam in find_minimal_vertical_seam</p>

-------------------------------------------------
You dont need to initialize seam in find_minimal_vertical_seam because it is already initialized before it is passed to this function. To edit values of seam though, just write seam[column] = newValue

fails for public test but works when tested seperately
<p>so I get 2 errors for the public test for two of my functions, the print and the row one, however when I tested them seperately with the same conditions in the int main() of a different cpp file, I get the correct answer. For some reason it is only giving a wrong value when the matrix_public_test.exe file is executed. Can someone say why this is happening?</p>

-------------------------------------------------
<p>What is the error code?<br/>For print, there could be a whitespace difference between the answer they want and what your code is printing. Your ppm printing could be "correct" in the sense that it's a valid ppm file, but the tests will test to make sure that it is exactly the same as their formatting. Try opening the Marix_public_test.cpp file to see what exactly your output is being compared to. Space and newline placement must be exact.</p>


<p>Hope this helps.</p>

-------------------------------------------------
<div class="markdown" id="q38kRj58oo0ooY"><p>The root cause is in your <code>Matrix_at</code> implementation. It appears to treat <code>row</code> and <code>column</code> as starting from 1 even though they actually start from 0. When <code>row == 0</code>, and <code>column == 0</code>, we’re referring to the valid top left cell of a matrix.</p>
<p>(How do we find this root cause? Your <code>Matrix_print</code> printed <code>42 1</code>, which suggests that the matrix’s width got set to 42 even though it got initialized to 1. Where could this have come from? Most likely line 49 of Matrix_public_test, where we have the most relevant appearance of 42. How did that end up setting the width instead? You might have stepped before of the <code>data</code> array and ended up overwriting the width instead. <strong>You can verify all of this by setting a breakpoint on that line 49 and stepping into <code>Matrix_at</code> in the debugger.</strong>)</p></div>

-------------------------------------------------
The matrix row function only prints a number row, when I do it seperately I get the correct answer which is 2 but through the test file they say error 1=! 2. For the print one, again I get what should be printed but on the test file it prints something else entirely for some reason.

resize runs error-free in XCode but not in terminal
<p>When I run this in terminal, it runs into this error. However, when I run it in XCode by editing the scheme and passing in these arguments, it runs error-free and creates a file with the specified dimensions, but the image looks very wonky. Since building in XCode does not catch this error, I can't use the debugger.</p>


<p>Does anybody know why this would be the case and how I would go about debugging this?<img alt="" height="70" src="/redirect/s3?bucket=uploads&amp;prefix=paste%2Fky2gseusan32e9%2Fe216a79d294065285ec0b4a1bb9aae97f780c30c946d4dde6c6687cede43ea63%2FScreen_Shot_2022-09-27_at_3.05.39_AM.png" width="591"/></p>


<p>Also I did make sure to "make resize.exe" right before this command.</p>


<p></p>


<p>Update: I split the assert statement into 5 assertions and found out it's failing column_start &lt; column_end.</p>


<p><img alt="image.png" src="/redirect/s3?bucket=uploads&amp;prefix=paste%2Fky2gseusan32e9%2F601f23abdbbaa82e554b5734c346d06102750ec77564f196625ae6d69e8fe911%2Fimage.png"/></p>


<p>I then put a breakpoint here. When I run it in XCode it should stop here since it fails the assert but it skips right over it.</p>

-------------------------------------------------
<p>When you run your code in XCode, does XCode rebuild it first? If so, it's possible XCode is removing your assert statements from the final build with a compiler argument like -DNDEBUG, which is why your asserts are being skipped in the debugger. Setting XCode to produce "Debug" builds (instead of "Release" ones) might fix this.</p>


<p>In ambiguous situations like this one, I recommend you try building and running your code on CAEN, as that is the closest environment to the autograder's. Hope this helps!</p>

<p>Thank you for your response.</p>

<p>I edited this to say "yes" instead of "include_source" but it did not work. Do you know how to set XCode to produce debug builds instead of release builds?</p>

-------------------------------------------------
<p>Hmm, sorry I'm not an XCode user. Someone else who is is free to chime in with advice here, but just so I don't keep you hanging, I'm thinking there is a bug in your code causing the assert to hit since you can reproduce it from the terminal, and since you said the output looks wonky (probably due to some invariant being broken, hence the assert).</p>


<p>Could you try running your code on CAEN please? If the assert hits there, then we know for sure there's a bug somewhere. Also, even though your asserts aren't hitting in XCode, you can always manually check the variable values in your debugger to see if anything seems suspicious. Hope this helps!</p>


<p></p>


<p>EDIT: Try running your code with the Address Sanitizer enabled, too. It's possible some undefined behavior is causing these inconsistencies.</p>

-------------------------------------------------
<p>Thanks for your response. I have run my code with the address sanitizer and it does not catch it.</p>

-------------------------------------------------
<p>Thank you. I was able to ssh into CAEN. Unfortunately, CAEN runs into the same error my terminal does. The build of my terminal and CAEN still differs from XCode. When I run it in XCode it does not stop at the breakpoint I set above even though it should be stopping there according to the output from my terminal and CAEN. I checked to see if breakpoints are working in general and they are. Why would the output from my terminal/CAEN be different from XCode?</p>

<p>Sounds like XCode is stripping asserts out when compiling your code. Unfortunately, I'm not sure how to disable this in XCode, outside of setting the build type to Debug. However, you can still debug effectively in XCode without the asserts working. Since you know which assert is being triggered, I recommend replacing it with an if-statement that checks the same condition, and that throws an exception or prints a relevant message. Then, set a breakpoint in the body of the if-statement, and re-run your debugger.</p>

-------------------------------------------------
<p>I've tried asserting false and this assert gets triggered. I also put a breakpoint in the if statement right above the assert statement and it does not pass through this (image in the post above). It seems like the values of column_end and/or column_start are different between what builds in terminal and what builds in XCode.</p>

-------------------------------------------------
<p>I found the bug in my code. Thank you for your help!</p>

resize.cpp functioning normally on my laptop but failing on the autograder
<p>My resize.cpp works normally when I test it on my machine. However, when I submitted it to the autograder, I lost the point for the "resize public test". It didn't finish running and had this error: "Error opening file: dog_4x5.out.ppm". How can I fix this?</p>

dog_cost_correct.txt Wrong or I'm Wrong?

<p></p>


<p>I'm a bit confused on how the dog_cost matrix is correct but mine isn't (I ran dog_cost test and failed). For example, if we look at my cost matrix, at row 2, column 0, the cost is (energy @ (row 2, column 0) + min(1470, 1148)) = 1470 + 1148 = 2618. If we look at dog_cost_correct Matrix, the cost value at row 2, column 0, is 4088. Am I understanding this recurrence relation wrong and how to calculate the cost matrix? Any tips or ideas?  </p>

-------------------------------------------------
<p>I'm good now! 👍 (I should have been looking at the min value of cost, not energy)</p>

<p>Oh wait, I think I'm looking at the min value of energy, not cost. </p>

Assert Failing
<p>I get the correct ppm files for dog, horses, and crabster files. However, when I include </p>


<p></p>


<p>column &lt; Matrix_width(mat)); in my Matrix_at functions or</p>


<p>column &lt; Image_width(img)); in my Image_set_pixel/Image_get_pixel, they all fail. </p>


<div><br/>I believe I narrowed it down to my processing.cpp file, the only assert I pass is if it is column &lt;= width, but I am not sure when I am passing in a column that is equal to the width. </div>


<div>
<div></div>
</div>




<div></div>

-------------------------------------------------
<p>I would recommend taking a very close look at your processing.cpp functions. The row and column bounds in your for loops might be the issue. Be extra careful since some of the processing functions require you to access matrix and image coordinates to the left right above and below of the current element (like with compute_energy_matrix). </p>


<p></p>


<p>Also, if you set a breakpoint at the start of the processing_public_tests you can step through the code until you see the error, then you will know that the code you just stepped through is an area that is passing in incorrect row/col pairs.</p>

<p>If you've not used the debugging tool very much, make sure to remember to open the launch.json file and change the "program" attribute to processing_public_tests.exe.</p>

Passing tests when I run it but failing on the Autograder
<p>Hi,</p>


<p>I have finished the processing file and was happy when I ran it on my computer and everything passed. However, when I put in it the autograder, it is still failing two public tests for processing. (specifically the horses and crabster test. If anyone can take a look and tell me why this is happening, my uniqname is jsegalla. </p>

-------------------------------------------------
<p>You're best bet for figuring out where it's failing on the autograder is by running your code on CAEN</p>

-------------------------------------------------
<p>I have done that multiple times but it just gives me the error that is generated by the autograder. I have also tried using a ton of cout statements to try to pinpoint the error but I just can not seem to find it. I don't know what else to do. Can you give me any insight from my autograder submission? </p>

Check if a file exists in resize.cpp
<p>How are we meant to check if a file exists in resize.cpp? I am currently using the is_open member function but when I try it on an output file that doesn't exist, the file is just created and my function doesn't put out an error.</p>

-------------------------------------------------
Your program seems to be working correctly. It is supposed to create/rewrite the output file of specified name. If there doesn't already exist an output file, it should create it with no error.
<div><br/><div>The only way I can think that opening the output file would fail is if there already exists a file with that name and you don't have permission to write to it.</div></div>

-------------------------------------------------
<p>But in the project specification, it says that if the output file cannot be opened, then we are supposed to output an error message and return a nonzero value. My program doesn't fulfill that requirement since the file is created when I call is_open on it.</p>

-------------------------------------------------
<p>Also, if it's intended for our program to create the output file if it doesn't exist, how are we supposed to test our "file does not exist" error implementation?</p>

-------------------------------------------------
<p>From the project spec:</p>


<p></p>


<p><img alt="image.pngNaN" src="/redirect/s3?bucket=uploads&amp;prefix=paste%2Fl7pepmm2tsbqm%2Fb7e1578859710a76a290bd2eae4b923173b1c02478da88eb18bdb5606dd858e6%2Fimage.png"/></p>


<p>I'm not sure what "file does not exist" error implementation you are referencing.</p>


<p>As I said in the answer, the only way I can think that an output file could not be opened is if there already exists a file with that name and you don't have permission to write to it. Your program should only output the error message and return a nonzero value when the file cannot be opened.</p>

in processing tests my functions are being given an uninitiated matrix
<p>Do I need to call matrix_init in my energy or cost functions? I assumed the matrix would be initialized before it is passed to my function.</p>

-------------------------------------------------
<div class="markdown" id="q38kRj58oo1ooY"><p>Yes, you will want to call Matrix_init() in the processing functions.</p>
<p>If you check out the functions in the processing_public_tests.cpp, you can see that:</p>
<p><img alt="image.png" src="/redirect/s3?bucket=uploads&amp;prefix=paste%2Fl7e8alqn6rj6u0%2F01c7626513f5a78f52dd0ecdf87cbbe7fbebbf54648f4cdc9ab68a02d02193c7%2Fimage.png"/></p></div>

-------------------------------------------------
<p>Here is an example, dog ran correctly, but when crabster tries to use the energy function the energy matrix is still the same size as it was for dog?</p>


<p><img alt="" height="143" src="/redirect/s3?bucket=uploads&amp;prefix=paste%2Fksyqill5z7v24a%2Fec76932a3afec1051516a8f1db33d287048f5aed50867cd56b0c1fefa46019bf%2FScreen_Shot_2022-09-27_at_10.21.33_AM.png" width="110"/></p>

-------------------------------------------------
<div class="markdown" id="q38kRj58oo0ooY"><p>Yeah, this is the reason why you want to Matrix_init() in the processing functions, because you never know which matrices will be passed in, each image will need a different size as you are seeing.</p></div>

Passing Processing tests on my computer but failing in the autograder
<p>I was wondering if anyone else's processing was running well on their computer but failing in the autograder? It passes all the tests when I run it but doesn't pass crabster or horses in the autograder and I do not know why. Does anyone have nay advice on this issue?</p>

-------------------------------------------------
<p>I would suggest running and debugging your code on the CAEN autograder-like environment.</p>

-------------------------------------------------
<div class="markdown" id="q38kRj58oo0ooY"><p>Fixed according to more recent autograder submissions. The error most likely stems from your program trying to allocate a ridiculously large amount of heap memory.</p></div>

-------------------------------------------------
<p>Ive done that but it just gives me the same error as the autograder which is not very helpful. I have tried using a ton of cout statements too but nothing is given me a indication of what is going wrong. :/</p>


<p>I don't know what to do at this point. </p>

-------------------------------------------------
<p>It's an assert statement throwing an error or is it a memory leak detection or other error?<br/>What error message do you get?</p>

-------------------------------------------------
This means it is not a problem with the auto-grader and you likely have some sort of undefined behavior in your program. Have you set up a visual debugger? Visual debuggers are super useful in situations like this because it lets you see the variables and objects during the runtime of the program.

-------------------------------------------------
<p>it's an assertion fail, specifically this one. I am attempting to use the debugger but I do not have that much experience with it and am having some difficulty using it. </p>

command line args resize
<p>Hello, quick question for the resize.cpp file regarding it accepting the command line arguments and other file reading/writing details. Am I allowed to assume that the arguments will always be passed in the order given by the example? Does the file I am writing to need to be created before resize runs or would resize create the file? How do I account for the directory that the files resize is reading from and writing to? Should I just assume that they are in the same directory as the program? </p>

-------------------------------------------------
<p>I think you can assume the arguments will always be passed in the order given by the example (I think they would include that in the error checking section if it was necessary).</p>


<p>The file you are writing to does not have to be created before running resize.</p>


<p>Assuming you are using fstream, the directory that you are reading and writing from depends on the input. If the input is a file path, you will read and write to the directory/file specified by the file path. If the input is just a filename, you will read and write to the same directory as the program. You don't have to account for the directory inside of your program.</p>

Errors
<p>I keep getting these errors in my Image functions, and I'm not sure how to resolve them. Additionally, I'm not really sure how to implement a pointer traversal, or if I should just do a regular nested for loop.</p>

-------------------------------------------------
<div class="markdown" id="q38kRj58oo0ooY"><p>For the first error, it doesn’t look like you’re using pointer traversal correctly. Your stepper var should be an integer that is added to the pointer to the first element in the array.</p>
<p>You can read more on pages 26 and 27 in lecture 4’s slides <a href="https://drive.google.com/drive/u/2/folders/1k81KJg0yGFnqn9vhZqlykjaMzZ0b2Mok" rel="noreferrer" target="_blank">here.</a></p>
<p>For your second error, <code>img-›red_channel.data = red</code> isn’t working for a couple of reasons.</p>
<p>One, <code>img-&gt;red_channel</code> gives a pointer to the red_channel matrix. You want to dereference this pointer in order to actually modify anything in that object. Also, I’m assuming <code>red</code> is an integer. <code>red_channel</code> is of course an integer array, and you cannot assign that a value of an integer.</p>
<p>Second, although there are other issues with this line as explained above, you do not want to be accessing the .data array from the channels directly. This is breaking the interface of Matrix since <code>red_channel</code> is a Matrix. You will want to use the Matrix_at() functions to set a particular value in this channel.</p>
<p>Hope this helps!</p></div>

Test Cases Involving fstream
<p>I am testing my image_init on fstream. I am able to pass an input file stream to init and output file stream to print. However, how do I compare the two files (i.e., the files created by print and the correct file)? I tried using ASSERT_TRUE(Image_equal(img1, img)) where img is the original file and img1 is what I printed after initializing but it didn't work.</p>

-------------------------------------------------
<p>In lecture we were briefly introduced to string streams. Using the std::istringstream and std::ostringstream from the #include &lt;cstdlib&gt; header, we can convert these stream's contents to strings and compare the strings.

Seam[] type not allowing for it to be added to
<p>I have written the find_minimal_vertical_seam and when debugging it gets all the right values but when it tries to add those values to the seam array, it doesn't do anything. My debugger says that seam[] is of type int* which is confusing because I thought that seam was just an array of integer column values. Does anyone know how to fix this?</p>

-------------------------------------------------
<p>Under the hood, an integer array is just a pointer to the address of the first integer in the array. The syntax arr[x] is translated by the compiler to *(arr + x). How are you adding the values to the seam array?</p>

-------------------------------------------------
<p>I tried doing *(seam + r) = x and it doesn't show the whole array in my debugger, it instead shows only one value in seam. </p>

-------------------------------------------------
<p>Can you not just use seam[r] = x ?</p>

-------------------------------------------------
<div class="markdown" id="q38kRj58oo0ooY"><p>As @fdm said, because this array is itself just a pointer, the debugger only shows the value that this points to (the first integer). That is normal behavior.</p></div>

-------------------------------------------------
I'm having the exact same problem, I've tried seam[x] and *(seam + x). Neither one has worked. seam always shows up as a const* int and when it's dereferenced it has a value of 0.

Testing Processing.cpp
<p>How do we actually test our functions in processing so we know where things went wrong? Currently running the processing public tests just tells me that an assertion in image_init has failed but it doesn't tell me what part of processing is wrong, or any other insight. </p>


<p></p>


<p>I know we are supposed to set up CAEN but what does that actually mean? Is it a website that we submit our files too? is it a command that we run that would give us more insight as to where our program went wrong? Thanks so much!</p>

-------------------------------------------------
<p>Setting up CAEN is specifically useful for debugging undefined behavior in an autograder-like enviroment (in cases where your program works on your local machine but not the autograder). See the CAEN setup for more information.</p>


<p><a href="https://eecs280staff.github.io/p1-stats/setup_caen.html" rel="noreferrer" target="_blank">https://eecs280staff.github.io/p1-stats/setup_caen.html</a></p>


<p></p>


<p>If your functions are not working properly on your local machine, you should try using a visual debugger to help find your bugs.</p>

-------------------------------------------------
<p>CAEN is the computing services team at UMichigan, and they have a platform/environment set up for you to develop on computers and laptops across Michigan. We use that environment as a "ground zero" since we run the autograder using the same environment/configuration.</p>


<p></p>


<p>As for a command to figure out what went wrong, I would highly recommend having your visual debugger on hand, since you can see the variables and objects during the runtime of the program.</p>

Matrix_print printing a random matrix
<p>Hello, I'm testing my Matrix_print function and it appears to be printing a random part of a matrix used in a different test</p>


<p><img alt="image.png" src="/redirect/s3?bucket=uploads&amp;prefix=paste%2Fksyvmvsawob4vs%2F3c8207c6658038acd3a2c91a6d0f076d4dc1a2c937e2e57bdc48d03f8b9aeab8%2Fimage.png"/></p>


<p></p>


<p>I've been deleting all the matrices in my tests, any ideas on what is going on?</p>


<p>Also if I change the values in the other test from 53 to 52 it changes the output as well. Not sure how they are connected</p>

-------------------------------------------------
Are you running Matrix_init() before using the matrix to set the size?

-------------------------------------------------
<p>Yes, this is how I'm initializing the matrix</p>

Allowed to use functions from starter code testing as helper functions
<p>Hello, I was wondering if we were allowed to copy and paste functions from files given to us at the start of the project into files we write as helper functions or if we have to somehow write our own different implementation of these functions?</p>

-------------------------------------------------
<div class="markdown" id="q38kRj58oo0ooY"><p>Are you referring to the files like Matrix_test_helpers.h? These header files are actually already included in the test.cpp files. You are encouraged to use them!</p>

Posting code on public github
<p>Hello,</p>


<p></p>


<p>I was wondering if there was any way to show potential employers projects that I have written in this class, by putting them on github. I obviously don't want to share anything I am not allowed to. Furthermore, if this is possible how would I properly credit the people who made this project.</p>


<p></p>


<p>Thanks so much!</p>

-------------------------------------------------
<p>You can put your code on github and share it with employers, but you have to make sure your repository is private so people don't have access to it.</p>

<p>Check to see what is above these lines, as sometimes something missing from the above lines will result in an error being flagged at a later line. A different example would be forgetting a semicolon and the line below having some unrelated sounding error.</p>

<p>This happens in Xcode if it thinks your <code>.h</code> file is C, rather than C++.</p>

<p>Select the affected file and then in the right side panel, change the type from C Header to C++ Header. Unfortunately, I can't find a good way to do this for all .h files automatically.</p>

<p>Also, I thought I'd head off any criticism of me taking a picture of my computer screen with my phone by pointing out that I actually took a video instead the first time I tried it.</p>

-------------------------------------------------
<p>The autograder did not throw any compile errors when I ran the same file. It went straight to running the public test for Image.cpp. I did not modify any header files or any lines above the struct so I am not sure why this error popped out of nowhere.</p>

-------------------------------------------------
Does this error show when compiling on your machine? If it's just an intellisense error,  try restarting xcode, as IDEs sometimes mess up with their error highlighting.

-------------------------------------------------
<p>I already restarted xcode and it's just throwing the same error. I cannot run any tests right now because of this issue.</p>

-------------------------------------------------
<p>I would also assume this is due to a missing bracket or semicolon somewhere (not necessarily something wrong with the code). I would redownload another copy of Image.h and see if that helps, you might have deleted a character or something without noticing</p>

-------------------------------------------------
<p>I just redownloaded Image.h and replaced it. It is still not fixing the error.</p>

-------------------------------------------------
<p>Can you force quit Xcode like so: <a href="https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT201276" target="_blank">https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT201276</a></p>

resize.cpp
<p>I understand that in resize.cpp we open a file, at the first index of argv and read from it into the output file, at the second index of argv. I'm confused about how to read in and write to an Image though. Will main only have two parameters, argv and argc? So do we create a new image object for this?</p>

-------------------------------------------------
<p>Yes main will only have two arguments: argv and argc. Yes you need to create a new image object and initialize it using the ifstream. Then, once you have run the processing functions on the image, you can run Image_print with an ofstream to write the image to a file.</p>

energy matrix border fill question
<p>The project spec states for the Energy Matrix:</p>


<p>3. Find the maximum energy so far, and use it to fill in the border pixels.</p>


<p></p>


<p>Do I fill the border pixels each time after calculating the energy(x)? (keeping it inside the 2D for loop)</p>


<p>or Do I fill the border pixels just once after the whole energy matrix is calculated? (outside the 2D for loop)</p>


<p></p>


<p>The way it says 'So Far' seems like there will be multiple maximum calculated by the time I end the energy matrix so Im kinda confused.</p>

-------------------------------------------------
According to the correct output in the tests, I would think it would be do ALL calculations first, then fill the border once you get the maximum energy

Mutation testing suites
In the autograder, everything passed except it shows me that I only caught 8/10 bugs. But I’m lost here on how to find the remaining two bugs. Does this mean that there’s something wrong with the function implementations? Any tips to catch the remaining two bugs of Matrix_tests??

-------------------------------------------------
<p>This does not mean there is something wrong with the function implementations. Think about edge cases for each function in Matrix.cpp and try to exploit possible bugs with your tests.</p>

-------------------------------------------------
<div class="markdown" id="q38kRj58oo0ooY"><p>Per the above, have you made sure to test all functions within <code>Matrix.cpp</code>? If yes, have you made sure to test every possible behavior, and consider the potential edge cases for each function?

Processing Public Tests

What is the failure code in your terminal?

<p>It passed before we made a few edits in the test files and resize, so idk why it's not passing now. Also on the AG, it still passes the processing tests</p>

-------------------------------------------------
<p>Did you guys by chance edit the MAX_MATRIX_WIDTH in Matrix.h? </p>


<p>This would make sense as AG does not account for any student edits to the header files.</p>

-------------------------------------------------
<p>Didn't touch them. They still show up on the AG like this...should this work or should I try and resolve it in my terminal?</p>


<p><img alt="Screen_Shot_2022-09-27_at_1.04.27_PM.pngNaN" height="226" src="/redirect/s3?bucket=uploads&amp;prefix=paste%2Fl7i20wztokn2or%2F2347a8540ad27542e6832f6d5c40e4b04b155d4555f03fdc08bb1afa34cbc552%2FScreen_Shot_2022-09-27_at_1.04.27_PM.png" width="862"/></p>

-------------------------------------------------
<p>It seems like if it compiles and runs successfully on AG then that's fine unless the error is stopping you from developing on your machine. I'll suggest restarting your computer as well but other than that I won't be much help beyond here 😬</p>


<p>Does this error trip on your partner's computer as well?</p>

-------------------------------------------------
<p>I see. Thanks! And yeah, it's also on his computer. But he restored it to an earlier version where all the tests did pass. Now he's just unable to push his working commit. Any idea how to do that?</p>

-------------------------------------------------
<p>The issue with pushing is that your partner is working on a version that is older than the remote repo which makes it so he can't push. Your partner would need to create a new branch in git and push that branch so you can checkout that branch (translation: start working on that new branch rather than the old one). If you are not familiar with how to do that, look up something like "git basics branching", or reach out to an instructor or IA in office hours.</p>

Image_init: how do I read in a temporary pixel?

-------------------------------------------------
<p>Use the set pixel function</p>


<p></p>


<p>Is this in the Image_init() function when reading an image from a file?</p>


<p>You will need to read in the first few chunks and set them as the width and height of the image, then use for loops to iterate through the remaining chunks which represent the r g and b values. Once you get the r, g, and b you can use the set pixel function.</p>

[Resolved in OH] Autograder Matrix_tests false positives, can't figure out what went wrong
<p>Hi,</p>


<p></p>


<p>I'm getting false positives on Autograder for the following tests:</p>


<div>
<div>
<div><i></i>test_column_of_min_value_in_row</div>
<div><i></i>test_max</div>
<div><i></i>test_min_value_in_row</div>
</div>
</div>


<p></p>


<p>Of these three, test_column_of_min_value_in_row and <i></i><i></i>test_min_value_in_row don't pass "Student Matrix tests on student Matrix" even though these tests pass when my partner and I run them from the command line. We tried debugging, but still can't figure out what went wrong. Could you help take a look at our code?</p>


<p></p>


<p>Thank you so much!</p>

Wrong output for image_print
<p>After running the image_public_test, I can't seem to get the correct output. I coutted the statements to show you my output in the terminal; if I place the fout outside of the loop it doesn't work because the variables aren't in scope. How can I fix this? In general, it's giving me the wrong values for the pixels as well; the public test is red, green /n blue, white but mine is blue n/ white n/ blue n/ white.</p>

-------------------------------------------------
<p>You do not need to use cout or fout in this function. You should use the provided output stream parameter, "os". For example, you should use it in the following way:</p>


<p></p>


<pre>os &lt;&lt; red &lt;&lt; <span class="hljs-string">" "</span> &lt;&lt; green &lt;&lt; <span class="hljs-string">" "</span> &lt;&lt; blue &lt;&lt; <span class="hljs-string">" "</span> &lt;&lt; <span class="hljs-built_in">endl</span>;<div class="compile_code"><button class="compile_code_button" data-id="compileCodeBtnId" onclick="return PE.openCodeRunner('b3MlMjAlM0MlM0MlMjByZWQlMjAlM0MlM0MlMjAlMjIlMjAlMjIlMjAlM0MlM0MlMjBncmVlbiUyMCUzQyUzQyUyMCUyMiUyMCUyMiUyMCUzQyUzQyUyMGJsdWUlMjAlM0MlM0MlMjAlMjIlMjAlMjIlMjAlM0MlM0MlMjBlbmRsOw==');">run code snippet</button><div class="code_runner_notify">Visit Manage Class to disable runnable code snippets<button onclick="return PE.dismissCodeRunnerNotice();">×</button></div></div></pre>

Style Checks Keep Failing on Autograder
<p>Whenever I submit my code to autograder, none of the style checks are running including the compile check. I was wondering if I missed a step somewhere that would allow for the style checks to compile? I keep getting output messages saying that I haven't passed the prerequisites.</p>


<p><a href="/redirect/s3?bucket=uploads&amp;prefix=paste%2Fkxuivh051c219a%2Ff1c3a8c7366179f7bae24a195449901d2c8a26109e91d06688ede055fd0d2131%2FScreen_Shot_2022-09-27_at_2.35.39_PM.png" rel="noreferrer" target="_blank">Screen_Shot_2022-09-27_at_2.35.39_PM.png</a></p>

-------------------------------------------------
<p>All of your code needs to compile for style checks to be run. It looks like the compiler error is coming from resize.cpp, and I think its because you don't have a main function defined in resize.cpp</p>

Potential Issue with matrix_fill
<p>I feel that the way I am stating <strong>*Matrix_at(mat, i, k) = value;</strong> in the last line might be causing an issue in my Matrix_fill code? If this is the case, could I be directed in a better direction as to what I may be missing/doing incorrectly?  <img alt="Screen_Shot_2022-09-27_at_2.43.14_PM.pngNaN" height="197" src="/redirect/s3?bucket=uploads&amp;prefix=paste%2Fkt1p9ldh2mi68c%2Ffb95c35a889eab5ffa5c18d7496896620a578bcf9cee8c2b9588b12485fb73e3%2FScreen_Shot_2022-09-27_at_2.43.14_PM.png" width="341"/></p>

Autograder processing_public_tests horses bad_alloc error
<p>I'm getting a bad_alloc error in the processing_public_tests horses section on autograder. I've seen other Piazza posts where the solution is to make sure that all objects created in dynamic memory with the new keyword are deleted. I've checked this an I'm still getting the error when I submit my code. Is there another source of this error that I should check for?</p>

-------------------------------------------------
<p>Based on your autograder submit, it seems like your test_matrix_init function in Matrix_tests.cpp and your test_get_pixel_edge function in Image_tests.cpp are leaking memory. Same goes for your resize.cpp in line 23. Make sure you are reading where the autograder memory leak outputs are directing you towards, the address sanitizer contains useful information in tracking down memory leaks.</p>

-------------------------------------------------

------------------------@1313-------------------------
compute_energy_matrix
<p>Just to clarify, for compute_energy_matrix, do we fill each non-border pixel with it's calculated energy, or do we leave the non-border pixels filled with 0, and only calculate the energy to find the max value, which we then use to fill the border-pixels?</p>

-------------------------------------------------
You first loop through the non-border pixels and calculate their energies, keeping a variable for the max energy. Then, once your loop is done, you set all of the borders to the max value.

Dog.ppm not opening in autograder
<p>Hello! My partner and I submitted to the auto grader this morning and it say that it is unable to open dog.ppm in the auto Grader. However, it works fine when ran locally and when ran through CAEN. Can we get any input? </p>

This means your program is failing to print the image to the output file.
<div> In my program, this was caused by my program incorrectly throwing an error when the width/height (from the command line argument) was equal to the image width/height. My inequalities for the error checking were &gt; instead of &gt;=</div>

Minimal vertical seam  returning the right values but not passing ?
<p>Hello we used cout statements on our minimal vertical seam  and got the desired values ( the reverse of the correct text file ) but we still fail the test why could this be? </p>


<p></p>


<p></p>

-------------------------------------------------
<p>Your values may be correct however they are not in the right order compared to the correct array. In find_minimal_vertical_seam, make sure that the last element of the seam array corresponds to the very bottom row of the matrix. (Sounds like you have the opposite of this) </p>

tests all work but the runtime fails with horse
<p>I've already finished my driver program and all tests pass will dog, crab, and horse. However, with the horse pictures, the tests take longer to run (which I was told was normal) but the autograder says I failed processing_public_tests horses, which I'm assuming is because of the long runtime. Any tips on reducing the runtime for these tests?</p>

-------------------------------------------------
<p>Make sure wherever you are using new you also use delete.</p>

-------------------------------------------------
<p>Hi. I had the same issue because in Matrix_at, I used the formula row * height + column, instead of row * width + column</p>

Error with image_init
<p>I'm testing the void Image_init(Image* img, std::istream&amp; is) function right now and I can't get it to work. I'm declaring three integers, width, height, and junk and I have two for loops to loop through image height and width and I'm reading in from is. But I keep getting an error. </p>

-------------------------------------------------
<p>I would suggest editing your processing_public_test.cpp to call Matrix_print on your energy matrix and the correct matrix before that assertion in order to compare them and see what your program is doing wrong. It would also be a good idea to setup and use a visual debugger if you haven't already.</p>

test processing and resize
<p>should we test processing and resize outside of the public tests?</p>

-------------------------------------------------
<p>You are not graded on your tests for these functions but it may be a good idea for you to test them outside of the public tests to catch any extra bugs that might cause your program to fail the private tests.</p>

Accounting for images with a width of 1
<p>Should our compute_vertical_cost_matrix and find_minimal_vertical_seam be written to account for images with a width of 1? I see that remove_vertical_seam "requires" that the Image points to a valid Image with a width &gt;=2, and it would make sense that this would apply to computing the vertical cost and finding the minimal vertical seam as well, given that an image with a width of one only has one seam that could be removed. But, it is not explicitly stated in the requires clause, so I figured it was worth asking to double-check.</p>


<p></p>

seam_carve error
<p>While running our tests for processing.cpp, our debugger showed us that all of our tests passed for the dog image, but when we tested crabster, the seam carve test fails, this is really confusing us because it worked for the first test and we're not sure where how we should continue from this point.</p>


<p><img alt="image.png" src="/redirect/s3?bucket=uploads&amp;prefix=paste%2Fl7ndln0sk405j1%2Fdcb07ee324b4643c25f68bcdced297fa517d162b4c5dc0fbe46febe0093354d9%2Fimage.png"/></p>

-------------------------------------------------
<p>Maybe try having a look at your seam_carve function and see how many times it carries out its carving action. For dog.ppm it only requires you to use seam carve once as it goes from 5x5 to 4x5 but for crabster you need to run the carving algorithm multiple times. Hope this helps in some way!</p>

-------------------------------------------------
<p>I'm getting this too! I'll let you know if I find the bug.</p>

-------------------------------------------------
<p>Please let us know!</p>

-------------------------------------------------
<p>👍</p>

-------------------------------------------------
<p>Alright, so apparently, every time you shrink the width by 1, you will have a new (and different) cost and energy matrix every time. I was using the same cost and energy matrix through every iteration, so that was my error.</p>

-------------------------------------------------
<p>THank you! You are my everything!</p>

-------------------------------------------------
<p>yes I am also getting this error. I will let you know if I find it</p>

-------------------------------------------------
<p>I found the error, at least in my code. </p>


<p>I suggest going into the makefile and changing the complier flags to include sanitizers (look at the image below). When you run it with the sanitizers AND on a CAEN computer (you can login into CAEN through your computer-&gt; look at the link below and follow the directions) it should give u an indication of what and where things are going wrong (the summary section is the most helpful and should specially tell you the file and line number it fails) In my case it was a indexing error, but it might be different for your. Hope this helps. </p>

-------------------------------------------------
<p>What exactly was your fix? The function itself is very simple, was there something missing somewhere else?</p>

-------------------------------------------------
<p>Yes there was. The seam carve functions themselves are not difficult because you use the other functions you have developed. However, this leads to the possibility of something in those functions potentially being wrong, so you have to be careful. In my case it was in my remove vertical seam function that I made the error. </p>

Idk but just put some test cases in the same “TEST” so you don’t have to worry about it. Went from 41 to 12 without testing anything less than I had been the other day.

How to test int* Matrix_at  vs const int* Matrix_at
<p>What is the difference in writing the test cases for these two functions? I wrote test cases for the int* Matrix_at function but I'm not sure how to write test cases for the const int* Matrix_at function.</p>

-------------------------------------------------
Copy a matrix into a const matrix, like this:
<div><br/></div>
<div>Matrix const *example_name = original_prepared_matrix;</div>

-------------------------------------------------
<p>Thank you! However, that means I cannot delete the matrix at the end of my test function since it is being declared as a const?</p>

-------------------------------------------------
<p>I believe you can delete the matrix, just not change it.</p>

-------------------------------------------------
You only need to delete original_prepared_matrix or example_name in this case, since they point to the same thing, the compiler will know that you’ve deleted it. Test it out, it’s quick, easy and free to see for yourself.

-------------------------------------------------
<p>The problem does not seem to be with your Matrix_column_of_min_value_in_row. Somewhere in your processing.cpp, you are likely passing it values that are out of bounds of the matrix. I would suggest looking where this function is used in processing.cpp and make sure there are no edge cases where you pass it invalid input. I would also suggest adding assert statments for the required clause of Matrix_column_of_min_value_in_row if you haven't already.</p>

-------------------------------------------------
<p>Normally this happens because of too many for loops in matrix.cpp. I think you should try to another way to do Matrix_fill_border specifically. There is no need to have 2 double/nested for loops, all you need is 2 single for loops.</p>


<p></p>


<p>- 1 for loop for filling the first and last column (this can be done in 1 loop)</p>


<p>- 1 for loop for filling the first and last row (this can be done in another separate for loop)</p>


<p></p>


<p>That should fix the issue</p>

<p>I'm having a similar issue even after adjusting Matrix_fill_border to use two for loops instead of a nested for loop.  What else should I look into to fix this?</p>

P2 Seam Carve Tests some work but some dont
Hi, when making the processing public test, there are some tests that are not passing. I am passing the 4x5 for dog and the 50x45; however, any of the other ones aren't passing. I have been to office hours and they can't seem to find the issue in our code. Is there any more information that may be useful?

<div class="markdown" id="q38kRj58oo0ooY"><p>Use the debugger or print to a file/console to see what your output is and what the expected output is. Then you can try to reverse engineer what went wrong. Alternatively, if the tests aren’t too big, you can step through the debugger and try to run through your expected algorithm alongside the computer to see where the program diverges from its intended behavior.</p></div>

-------------------------------------------------
<p>You should not be using for loops in matrix_column, matrix_row, or matrix_at. There is a way to do them without loops, there's just a little math involved. If you use loops your code will time out in the autograder for the processing tests usually</p>

<p>without any bounds checking. What if there are only 4 arguments total? Then this will access memory that shouldn't be accessed, and it might crash, or it might run with undefined behavior. You should be checking whether you have enough arguments before reading in the arguments.</p>


<p></p>


<p>Secondly, it looks like you're printing the image before making any modifications to it. You should be printing it after you've done seam_carve_width() (and also seam_carve_height() if it needs to be done).</p>

I don't know what the issue is, it would be awesome if I could have some input.</p>

-------------------------------------------------
<p>It seems like one of your processing functions is indexing out of bounds when it calls image_set_pixel which calls Matrix_at. I would recommend adding asserts in your Matrix_at and Image_set_pixel aligned with the requires clauses to debug and trace back which processing function is indexing out of bounds.</p>

<p>You are setting ptr = img2, meaning that these two pointers point to the same memory address. Then at the end of the function, you delete both ptr and img2 which point to the same memory address, effectively causing a double delete. </p>

remove_vertical_seam unnecessary step

<p>We can simply iterate through each row, each column, and start shifting each pixel to the left once column passes the index in seam</p>

Undefined reference to _____ (functions of Image and Processing called in resize.cpp)
<p>I've basically finished writing resize.cpp, but I encountered an error that requires me to debug. However, these errors always pop up when I run the debugger and terminate my debugging</p>


<p><img alt="image.pngNaN" src="/redirect/s3?bucket=uploads&amp;prefix=paste%2Fky1zo9pohav4xm%2Feb6d4c87fdb38cfc2e49d13dcdfb8d17a8191de15d70d86091776cb060c89534%2Fimage.png"/></p>

-------------------------------------------------
<p>Have you included "processing.h" at the top of your resize.cpp file?</p>

-------------------------------------------------
<div class="markdown" id="q38kRj58oo0ooY"><p>Have you been able to run this successfully with the command line? If so, make sure that the files you’re including in the debugging session are the correct ones.</p></div>

-------------------------------------------------
<p>Yes i've included that file</p>

-------------------------------------------------
<p>So do these errors cause you to not be able to compile? Or is it just something to do with the debugger?</p>

remove_vertical_seam function does not pass public test
<p>Hello!<br/><br/>It is already late but I have really been sitting on it for the whole day. The function looks very right to me regardless of how many times and in how many ways I am going through it, and I read through all advice on Piazza. Can someone help me to look over the code? Is this something that instructors can help with when I only post my code to instructors? Please disregard this if I am not allowed to share my code at all but I am also running out of options :(</p>


<p></p>


<p></p>


<p>Thank you!<br/><br/>Best,</p>

-------------------------------------------------
<p>Consider this case when seam[i] == Matrix_width. What will happen in your inner loops when copying over pixels from the original image to the smaller image with the seam removed? Your loop copying pixels after the seam may run into trouble.</p>

-------------------------------------------------
<p>The else if should be accounting for it, right? It doesn't look like I am considering the right-most value, but I actually am writing a condition for it while considering that t is 0-indexed.</p>

<p>However, it somehow passed the dog test suddenly, and I don´t think I changed anything ... Hopefully it will pass all the other ones.</p>

Width for temp image remove_vertical_seam()
<p>How can I initialize my smaller temporary image to have a width one pixel smaller than the original without altering the width of the original? When I initialized my temp image, I tried to use Image_width(img) - 1 in the width parameter of Image_init. Running the debugger showed that this was decrementing the width of the original image too. How do I go about fixing this?</p>

-------------------------------------------------
<p>you can do it when u initialize the "temp" image u create </p>

-------------------------------------------------
<p>I did try doing the init function and passing my temp image, the width of the original image - 1, and the height of the original image but for some reason it's making the width of the original img one less than it should be even though I passed temp into the function. Img keeps its dimensions if I pass the width of the original image without subtracting 1, but then my final image has a "junk" column at the end.</p>

-------------------------------------------------
<p>So it seems like *img = *temp is what's causing the original image's dimensions to change but I'm not sure why because I wrote this line at the very end of the function and I'm not sure how else I would copy the temp image into the original.</p>

-------------------------------------------------
<p>I'm having the same problem, getting a junk column at the end as well. Were you able to figure it out?</p>

Horse works in CAEN but fails the autograder

resize.cpp Respecting the Interface

Matrix_at is causing errors in resize.cpp and processing.cpp

<p>We have checked all of our errors on autograder and everything seems to lead back to Matrix_at. We are very confused what is wrong with this code. It is causing resize.cpp to have a runtime error and none of our processing tests can run. We also just resubmitted to the autograder our uniquenames are rbhanu and raveena.</p>

-------------------------------------------------
<p>It looks like you fixed some stuff since you last submitted, but I'll let you know what I found in your new submission.</p>


<p></p>


<p>From what I'm seeing, it actually looks like your problem is in Image_print() (the one that takes an istream) and Image_print(). You're using "column += 3" and basically skipping 2 pixels every time you read one in. You should just be incrementing by one in every iteration.</p>

P2 Seam Carve Tests some work but some dont
Hi, when making the processing public test, there are some tests that are not passing. I am passing the 4x5 for dog and the 50x45; however, any of the other ones aren't passing. I have been to office hours and they can't seem to find the issue in our code

-------------------------------------------------
<div class="markdown" id="q38kRj58oo0ooY"><p>Sorry for the late reply! I would take a look at your Matrix_fill_border implementation. Hope this helps!</p></div>

-------------------------------------------------
<p>Use your debugger to follow where it fails. If you don't know how to use it, you need to learn, it is the only practical way to find the issue in your code. I'm leaving my answer here in case you're hoping an instructor will see this, so that it is not marked as good.</p>

-------------------------------------------------
I have tried using the debugger and went to office hours and no solution was found. I was posting here if anyone had the same issue.

-------------------------------------------------
<p>I hope you find someone that can share their issue, I really do, but the reality is that even if they have the same error at the same time, it is very likely that it's not from the same bug. It sounds like you could probably keep using the debugger even more, I would suggest really giving it your best shot, as it will absolutely 100% lead you to your problem. You still have a lot of time, enough time that you could do the whole project again -- I'm not saying you should at all, but you definitely have enough time to use the debugger to find your error.</p>

Test cases and grading
<p>If a few of my functions in the processing.cpp file are not working, do I still have the chance to get the points for the private test cases for matrix and image?</p>


<p><br/>Also, if some of my test cases are wrong (solely due to erroneous test case code), will the program still check the other test cases and even allow full points if I can cover all private test cases? </p>

-------------------------------------------------
<p>1. Sure you do, but don't give up yet, you have a day to do the project still and the project is more than doable in that time frame. Like you could do it even if you had to start from scratch in that time. Don't give up yet.</p>


<p>2. I'm not sure exactly what you mean, but it will tell you which of your test cases are valid, i.e. which ones gave a pass to working code, and which ones are invalid, i.e. gave a failure to working code. Regardless of the number of invalid cases that you have, the autograder will take your valid ones and use them, and not take off points for invalid test cases that you have.</p>

compute_vertical_cost_matrix
<p>I have completed these steps</p>


<ol><li>Initialize the cost <code>Matrix</code> with the same size as the energy <code>Matrix</code>.</li><li>Fill in costs for the first row (index 0). The cost for these pixels is just the energy.</li></ol>


<p>However, I am confused about filling the rest of the cost matrix. I know that we need the min energy of the three pixels straight above, left, and right. But how do get the energy of those pixels ? Do I have to call square difference or do I have to copy the entire energy matrix onto the cost matrix and then use the energy of those pixels (now in cost) to compute the cost?</p>


<p></p>


<p>Also, how do I think about staying in bounds?</p>


<p></p>


<p>thank u! </p>


<p></p>

-------------------------------------------------
<p>you can use a pointer to the same row and column in the energy matrix</p>


<p></p>


<p>and do some loop and pointer trick with it to set the values of the cost matrix equal to the values of the energy matrix</p>


<p></p>


<p>u need to use the below formula as the spec states</p>


<p><img alt="image.pngNaN" src="/redirect/s3?bucket=uploads&amp;prefix=paste%2Fksuyzte8rtb3ak%2Fabf3faa1754fccf6b406dec178004bf5ab34323fa4fe60836e815a982fe97b66%2Fimage.png"/></p>


<p></p>


<p></p>


<p>and to stay in bounds, just use some if else statement around your loop and modify the formula in the spec according to your needs</p>

-------------------------------------------------
<p>Omggg thank u! but do I need to copy the entire energy matrix onto the cost ? </p>

-------------------------------------------------
<p>you need to initialize the cost matrix as same size of the energy matrix.. but u can't copy the entire matrix because you will do that eventually by calculating the cost step by step and adding the cost value to the cost matrix. At the end u will have a matrix filled with cost. Feel free to ask again if it doesn't clear up</p>

Couple questions about resize.cpp
<p>For resize, I think I have the first few steps correct, but then I'm a little lost on the rest. I use ifstream and open the file using argv[1], create a new image, and then call Image_init to initialize the height and width. After that I then close the file. Is this the point at which I close the file or do I wait until the very end?</p>


<p></p>


<p>My thought was to create if and else-if statements to initialize the image based on if there are 4 or 5 arguments. And then I called seam_carve, but then the program just seems to stop after that (when I go through it with my debugger), so it never makes it to Image_print. Is there something that I am doing wrong or missing?</p>

-------------------------------------------------
<p>You can close the input file after initializing the image. I don't think whether there are 4 or 5 arguments should change how you initialize the image. What it does change though, is what parameters you call seam_carve with. In the case where there is a height argument, you pass that argument to seam_carve. In the case where there is not a height argument (argc = 4), you pass the Image_height of the input image to seam_carve. I am not sure why your program seems to stop. I would take a careful look at your if-then logic.</p>

-------------------------------------------------
<p>Do we have to do anything with ofstream before we get to Image_print?</p>

-------------------------------------------------
<p>Yes. You should open the output file using .open(filename) on your ofstream where filename is the name of the output file (argv[2]).</p>

-------------------------------------------------
<p>Ok so I finally figured this out... after a lot of digging :P Putting this here to explain what I did wrong and maybe someone else did wrong as well.</p>


<p></p>


<p>test_remove_seam creates the correct image struct (through load_image) using YOUR image_init function. Specifically, it uses the version that uses an istream. The issue with my code was there. In my situation, I attempted to directly save a value into img's height and width using (*img).height, instead of using the other image_init function (that inputs height width values) instead.</p>

<p>Anyways hoped this helped anyone else in the same position as me.</p>

Resize stopping at seam_carve
<p>When I call seam_carve in resize.cpp, my program seems to be stopping there. When I step into the function, and then step into seam_carve_width, which is called in seam_carve, I seem to be able to identify that it is when compute_energy_matrix is being called that the function is stopping. Because the image is so big, it takes forever to go step by step through compute_energy_matrix, so I can't seem to figure out what the issue is. All my processing functions are also passing any tests we've run. I tried to step through for as long as I could, but wasn't finding any issues. Any thoughts on what could be the problem?</p>

-------------------------------------------------
<div class="markdown" id="q38kRj58oo0ooY"><p>If your program is stopping on an exception, you can use the visual debugger to show you the state of all the variables when the program hits the exception and what line of code it does so on.

How do I call Image_print to the output file? resize.cpp

-------------------------------------------------
<p>First you should create an ofstream, then you should open the ofstream using .open(filename), then you should call Image_print with the image and the ofstream object as arguments.</p>

-------------------------------------------------
<p>I was attempting to do this:</p>


<p>I declared an ofstream called output and used output.open(filename), but I'm confused on how to read Image_print into the output now. I tried output &lt;&lt; Image_print(img, ___) but I'm not sure how to fill in the second argument. Is the output &lt;&lt; syntax correct? </p>

-------------------------------------------------
<p>You just want to call Image_print(img, output)</p>


<p>no &lt;&lt;</p>

Testing
For functions that do not explicitly say in the RME that width and height have to fit in certain parameters, should we assume that the width and height can be anything? 
<div><br/></div>
<div>For example for Matrix_print, can the read-in width and height be outside the parameters required by matrix_init</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>Thank you so much!</div>

-------------------------------------------------
<div class="markdown" id="q38kRj58oo0ooY"><p>I don’t think that it can because the requires clause for each Matrix function specifies that the matrix passed in will be a valid matrix, which I am assuming means that it was properly initialized with <code>Matrix_init</code> and would thus not have such a value.</p></div>

accessing width and height of resize input file
<p>Hi, how do I access the width and height of the input image in resize? the file is passed in as a command line argument, so do I need to convert it to a string, which would be the name of the image? do i then access the width and height? thank you</p>

-------------------------------------------------
<div class="markdown" id="q38kRj58oo0ooY"><p>You do need to initialize the image from the file in <code>resize</code>, and after doing that you can find the height and width of the Image easily using the interface functions (<code>Image_width</code>, <code>Image_height</code>).</p></div>

Resize public test not passing but getting point
<p>My resize public test is not passing in the autograder but I'm getting the point for it. Does this mean there is a bug in my code that may cause a private test to fail?</p>

resize.cpp
<p>I'm having a problem with the error checking component: </p>


<ul><li>There are 4 or 5 arguments, including the executable name itself (i.e. <code>argv[0]</code>).</li><li>The desired width is greater than 0 and less than or equal to the original width of the input image.</li><li>The desired height is greater than 0 and less than or equal to the original height of the input image.</li></ul>


<p>I'm getting the error when I run it, so I tried commenting out one of them at a time to see which one was the issue, and it's the last one regarding height. The reqs for width and height are exactly the same so I used the same if and || statement parameter, but it fails for height and works for width. </p>

-------------------------------------------------
<p>Have you differentiated between input with 4 vs 5 arguments? If the input has 4 arguments, there is no height argument. This will cause an error if you are using the same error checking for both situations.</p>

-------------------------------------------------
<p>Yes I separated between argc = 4 and argc = 5. I put the width error checking if statement within the argc = 4 branch since it would not have a height argument, and the height error checking if statement within the argc = 5 branch, and the error is coming from the argc = 5 branch. </p>

-------------------------------------------------
<p>What exactly is the error message? Does it just print the one you made?</p>

-------------------------------------------------
<p>Yes, it prints this from the spec:</p>


<p>Usage: resize.exe IN_FILENAME OUT_FILENAME WIDTH [HEIGHT]</p>


<p>WIDTH and HEIGHT must be less than or equal to original</p>

-------------------------------------------------
<p>Can you upload a picture of your implementation</p>

-------------------------------------------------
<p>Am I allowed to do this </p>

-------------------------------------------------
<p>It may be tedious, but you could try to break up the if then statements individually to see which one is causing the error.</p>

-------------------------------------------------
<p>Okay, I separated it even further into *argv[4] &lt;= 0 and *argv[4] &gt; height, and turns out its the *argv[4] &gt; height causing the issue. But then again I still don't know why</p>

-------------------------------------------------
<p>This is comparing argv[4] as a c-string to the int height. You need to call stoi() or atoi() on it to change it to an integer. Also, you don't need to dereference it using *, since the arr[] syntax dereferences the array for you.</p>

-------------------------------------------------
<p>Oh I see... Does this mean when I declared a string filename in the beginning to be argv[1], that is also incorrect? </p>

-------------------------------------------------
<p>No, I think that is OK. </p>

-------------------------------------------------
<p>Okay, so I took your advice and changed my parameter to atoi(argv[4]) &gt; height, and that same parameter is still causing the error message. Is this syntax still incorrect? (changed every instance of *argv[x] to atoi(argv[x])</p>

-------------------------------------------------
<p>I just realized. You have the inequality backwards. Argv[4] should be &lt; height</p>

-------------------------------------------------
<p>Ok I changed that and it doesn't give the error anymore, but shouldn't it be &gt;? Since the spec says "less than or equal to the original height of the input image", shouldn't the error be printed when the argument is greater than the height? </p>

-------------------------------------------------
<p>Ok so your saying that if atoi(argv[4]) &gt; height: then you throw the error?</p>

-------------------------------------------------
<p>This logic is correct. I guess it possible that you have initialized your "height" variable with the wrong value</p>

-------------------------------------------------
<p>Yes that's what I thought</p>

-------------------------------------------------
<p>The height integer would just be Image_height(__created_image_name__) right?</p>

-------------------------------------------------
<p>Right. It is possible you didn't create your image correctly. </p>

-------------------------------------------------
<p>Wouldn't it just be the same format we created images in all the other files, Image *img = new Image; ?</p>

-------------------------------------------------
<p>Right. How did you call the Image_init function?</p>

-------------------------------------------------
<p>I passed the arguments Image_init(img, input) where input is the name of the ifstream I created which contains the file of argv[1] </p>

-------------------------------------------------
<p>This is all correct. I am stumped.</p>


<p>When you say ifstream "contains" argv[1] you mean you ran ifstream_name.open(filename) where filename is a string containing argv[1]?</p>


<p>I would highly suggest you try using a visual debugger to see the values of argv[4] and height when the error is called.</p>

-------------------------------------------------
<p>Yes, exactly that. filename is a string set equal to argv[1], and then I wrote ifstream input(filename) and then opened using input.open(filename)</p>

-------------------------------------------------
<p>I think writing ifstream input(filename) is your problem. I don't know what the parenthesis after the variable name would do.</p>


<p>When declaring the ifstream, get rid of the parenthesis and just write ifstream input;</p>

-------------------------------------------------
<p></p>

<p>Using the debugger, this is the value of argv right before the error, using atoi(argv[4]) &gt; height</p>


<p></p>

-------------------------------------------------
<p>Height should definitely not be -10000000. I think you are not properly reading the input file and my previous reply is likely the issue</p>

-------------------------------------------------
<p>Okay, yeah, I changed it according to your last piece of advice and now I am not getting the error! Is Image_print() supposed to be the last call in resize.cpp? Now when I run it, there's a pause, then nothing happens. </p>

-------------------------------------------------
<p>Besides output.close(), yes. Also don't forget to delete the image you created.</p>

-------------------------------------------------
<p>Can I put input.close() and output.close() all the way at the bottom at the end of the program or is there a correct "time" to close them? Thank you very much for everything by the way</p>

-------------------------------------------------
I am unsure about this. I just closed my input after initializing the image and closed my output at the end of the file but I don't think it matters. 
<div>Just based off intuition, it seems like I wouldn't want to open an output stream before first closing my input stream in case they interfere in some way. </div>

compute_vertical_cost_matrix failing for Crabster.ppm
<p>I'm having trouble passing the crabster cost test. I don't know how else to change my implementation since it already passes the dog cost test. I understand the the crabster tests involve more edge cases, but I am also having trouble seeing which cases could break this implementation. I used the formula on the spec and believe that I am reading in the right columns. <img alt="" height="677" src="/redirect/s3?bucket=uploads&amp;prefix=paste%2Fkt7frw223956j4%2F8cee89fc68cfd590309f1c8a08c29206b37ef9558c83b5b9fc01416dfc943064%2FScreen_Shot_2022-09-28_at_12.03.48_AM.png" width="1120"/></p>

Resize output creates new file instead of failing
<p>If I understand the specification correctly, in resize.cpp, we are supposed to print out the message "Error opening file: ..." when you cannot open the input or output file with the given name. However, in my code, instead of having an error and printing out this message, a new file is created with the given name and the output is printed into that file. Is there a way to make this output fail instead of creating a new file so that the error message will be printed?</p>

-------------------------------------------------
<p>Your code is supposed to create the output file, not throw an error.</p>

-------------------------------------------------
<p>When the files cannot be opened or the argc is not the correct numbers, you are supposed to print out error messages and return with the error status (so the program is terminated). If you do not return in time, the program will keep running, and you may create new files.</p>

seam carve not working, every solution attempted
<p>Every single test in every single test case works up until seam_carve_width, where it doesn't work. To me this is logically impossible to fix because it finds the right seam to remove and does so correctly for one line. I am even creating a new energy matrix, cost matrix, and vertical seam and removing said seam, every single step until it reaches the new width. I would greatly appreciate if anyone had any possible explanation(i am unable to analyze 2000+ pixels accurately) as I am completely out of options.</p>

-------------------------------------------------
<p>Do you have a for loop that loops through each function? I am using one and an issue I encountered was that the upper bound of i would be Image_width(img)-newWidth. The problem is that Image_width(img) is changing as the for loop does its thing, so it would only loop through half of the time it should have. To fix this I just made a temp variable for the original width, instead of using image_width(img) in the for loop. Hope this answers your question</p>

-------------------------------------------------
<p>If anyone has literally any thoughts, suggestions, any questions, please put them here. I am at the brink right now and am unable to figure out how to use the debugger or CAEN effectively. </p>

-------------------------------------------------
<p>I was having a very similar problem. Make sure you're initializing the seam array correctly. As soon as I fixed that, mine started to work.</p>

-------------------------------------------------
<p>How much will this tank my grade if this doesn't work at all?</p>

<p>making a temp variable for width made no difference unfortunately. please is there any other solutions or should i cut my losses?</p>

Seam_carve_height
The instructions explicitly say to rotate left then apply seam_carve_width then rotate right, which is only three lines of code. I tried this, but the public processing tests pass for everything except crabster_70x35 though. Is there more to seam_carve_height than just rotating?

-------------------------------------------------
<div class="markdown" id="q38kRj58oo0ooY"><p>Nope. My <code>seam_carve_height</code> was a three liner as well.</p></div>

-------------------------------------------------
<p>I've got the same issue. I've been looking for an hour and have no idea what could be causing it.</p>

-------------------------------------------------
I would guess your issue is in a function other than seam_carve_height.

Matrix_init error
<p>What could the error "Use of deallocated memory" indicate in Matrix_init? My partner and I never got this error until trying to run resize.</p>

-------------------------------------------------
<p>From your most recent autograder submission, I would take a look at your seam_carve_width function. It looks like you allocate dynamic memory for energy/cost matrices once at the beginning of the function, but then attempt to deallocate them in every iteration of your while loop. I would suggest moving those deletes to the end of the function (after the while loop). Otherwise, you are trying to reuse these matricies in the next iteration of the while loop, even though they have been deallocated.</p>

-------------------------------------------------
<div class="markdown" id="q38kRj58oo0ooY"><p>This is just a guess, but perhaps you deleted something and then tried to access it later? For example:</p>
<pre><code>Image *img = new Image;
Image_init(img, 5, 5);
Image_fill(img, {255, 255, 255});
delete img;
Image_set_pixel(img, 0, 0, {0, 0, 0});

-------------------------------------------------
<div class="markdown" id="q38kRj58oo0ooY"><p>Have you tried running your code on CAEN? It functions in a similar environment to the autograder and may find bugs in how your code compiles on different setups. The main cause for this problem (at least in project 1) was that VSCode or local compilers on your computer may detect libraries automatically and CAEN/autograder would not. However, it could also be another error, so it doesn’t hurt to check and run it on CAEN.</p>

<p>I'm confused on why I am getting an Image_get_pixel error. I'm not sure what test is trying to be run since the processing_public_tests are supposed to announce what is being tested at the time. I did find that the row value inputted fails the assertion statement in Image_get_pixel (row value inputted equals Image_height(img)), however I don't know where that value is coming from to try to fix it. Moreover, my code works for dog.cpp, but not crabster or horses--crabster and horses both give the same Image_get_pixel error.</p>

-------------------------------------------------
<p>Update, it seems that when I try to run compute_energy, that is when I get the error. The row is inputted as 45, when 45 is the total height. This is an out of bounds error right?</p>

Project Two Error in Processing File
Hello Instructors,
<br/>
<br/>
My partner: Benny Huang (bennyh)
<br/>
Me: Tiffany Tang (tifftang)
<br/>
<br/>
My partner and I were working on our project two and we came across an issue where the seam carve test functions work for the first two, but not the rest of them. This causes us to fail the points on autograder for processing crabster and horses. We attended virtual office hours and had 3 different IAs take a look and they could not seem to find the issue. These IAs were Justin, Joshua, and Elizabeth. Joshua mentioned that he would talk with the instructors about our issue. We used both the debugger and CAEN to try to fix this issue, and still no one was able to identify where. My partner and I were wondering if you guys had any input into our issue. Our latest submission is in autograder if you need to access our code.
<br/>
<br/>
Please let us know if you have any questions and thank you so much for your help.
<br/>

Sincerely,
<br/>

Resize printing to terminal
<p>When I run resize, something is supposed to print to the terminal, correct? I'm using ifstream and ofstream, opening the file using argv[1], creating a new image and initializing it, opening the ofstream file using argv[2], and then closing the original file. I'm then calling seam_curve the width and height depending on whether a height argument was given or not, and then calling Image_print on the image I created, with the second argument being fout (using ofstream). I then delete the image and that's it. I know it's hard without seeing my code exactly, but any thoughts on what could be wrong?</p>

-------------------------------------------------
<div class="markdown" id="q38kRj58oo0ooY"><p>If resize is run with correct arguments and goes through all the steps you listed like it’s supposed to, then no resize should not print anything to the terminal.

Importance of Respecting the Interface in Private Tests
<p>I was just wondering how much respecting the interface mattered in terms of the private tests, because for our processing function we've used a lot of functions with parameters that don't respect the interface and we wanted to know if that would be a significant problem in the private tests. Our code does still run and we're compiling and passing all the public tests.</p>

-------------------------------------------------
<div class="markdown" id="q38kRj58oo0ooY"><p>It was mentioned in lecture that it is normally impractical to check that a program is respecting the interface, but that it is bad practice not to. I don’t know specifically if they will check this in the private tests, but they do have sections in the autograder where they attempt to check this, so I would err towards the careful size and respect the interface more.

-------------------------------------------------
<div class="markdown" id="q38kRj58oo0ooY"><p>This is part of the set of commands that <code>make test</code> runs. The first command,</p>
<pre><code>./resize.exe dog.ppm dog_4x5.out.ppm 4 5
</code></pre><p>runs your resize program to make <code>dog_4x5.out.ppm</code>. The second command,</p>
<pre><code>diff dog_4x5.out.ppm dog_4x5.correct.ppm
</code></pre><p>compares the files <code>dog_4x5.out.ppm</code> and <code>dog_4x5.correct.ppm</code> bit by bit to see where they have any difference. If they don’t have any difference, the <code>diff</code> program will print nothing to the terminal. So if that diff command is the last line you see, then <code>dog_4x5.out.ppm</code> and <code>dog_4x5.correct.ppm</code> are identical.</p></div>

-------------------------------------------------
<p>The student's answer is spot on! Just to add on, if there is a difference between the files, it can be hard to go through the differences sometimes using the diff command because of the way it is formatted.

<p></p>

-------------------------------------------------
<div class="markdown" id="q38kRj58oo0ooY"><p>Typically when the runtime encounters large numbers like this, you are looking at or trying to use initialized data. Check that your <code>init</code>, <code>get</code>, and <code>fill</code> functions are doing what they are supposed to be doing and defining bounds/values correctly.</p>
<p>It may also help to set up the debugger to see which variable is being assigned the <code>-1094795781 * -1094795781</code> value so you can pinpoint what is causing the problem.</p></div>

Changing MAX_MATRIX_WIDTH/HEIGHT for tests
<p>Say I want to write test cases that will check my funcions are working when matrix_height/width are equal to the MAX_MATRIX_WIDTH/HEIGHT. I was thinking making the maxes smaller in matrix.h in order to make it run faster, or should I just keep it 500x500 since the autograder will use those values? </p>

-------------------------------------------------
<div class="markdown" id="q38kRj58oo0ooY"><p>You should keep it 500 and 500 - I don’t see how changing these would make the program run faster. When the program creates the initial data array in <code>Matrix</code>, it shouldn’t run slower depending on the size of the array, since it isn’t initializing anything in that array yet. It’s just sectioning off an area of memory that’s marked for your to use later. Unless your system is really strapped for memory, initializing a 250000 size array shouldn’t take much more time than a 250 size array.</p>
<p>If you do have an efficiency problem, I would suggest looking into your getter and setter functions (<code>Matrix_at</code>, down the line <code>Image_get_pixel</code>, <code>Image_set_pixel</code>). These functions are used often and need to be fast for every other function to be fast.</p></div>

<p>Good morning!<br/><br/>My function passed the dog tests, but I read in other piazza posts that the other public tests are harder to pass. I am not passing the crabster test now, and I can´t think of other ways to improve the function anymore. If anyone has time, I would appreciate if you can look over it! :) Thank you so much!<br/><br/></p>

Resize Terminal Output/Checks
<p>Im a little confused on how to tell if resize/the program is actually working. When i run a command like "./resize.exe horses.ppm horses_400x250.ppm 400 250" in the terminal it runs fine with no errors but nothing is printed out to the terminal and im not sure how to check that it actually worked? </p>

-------------------------------------------------
<div class="markdown" id="q38kRj58oo0ooY"><p>If you look at the last command in the Makefile for <code>test</code>, the command is <code>diff dog_4x5.out.ppm dog_4x5.correct.ppm</code>. This command compares your output file with the given “correct” file. If you see nothing in the command line after running this command, then the files have the same contents.</p>

Find veritcal seam issue
<p>IK this is a repost but the op seems to have figured it out but haven't responded how. If anyone knows how to do this I kindly thank you if you share how</p>


<p></p>


<p></p>


<p>I cant for the life of me figure out why, but my find_minimal_vertical_seam function reaches out of bounds for its final column to put into the seam array. It works normally until row 0 where it then jumps from column 2 to column 0 (It is supposed to be 1 for the public test) which should not be possible.</p>


<p></p>


<p>It's not an out of bounds error or anything either, I have tested for that. If anyone has faced a similar problem help would be greatly appreciated.</p>

-------------------------------------------------
<p>I had the same confusion when I was doing this function as well. By the spec, <a href="https://eecs280staff.github.io/p2-cv/#minimal-vertical-seam" rel="noreferrer" target="_blank">right here</a>, the left and right bounds for searching for the minimum must change every time the col for the seam changes. It's possible to have a seam to travel from one corner to the other. The columns that the minimum search is bound to may change every time you move up a row.</p>


<p></p>


<p>I hope this helps.</p>

resize.cpp
<p>How can I know if my driver is working properly? For all .ppm tests, there's a pause for the larger .ppm's then nothing happens. How can I make sure it's all working properly before submitting to the autograder? </p>

-------------------------------------------------
<p>If the ppm files are taking more than about 30 seconds each, you may have a memory leak that is causing your processing tests with the large ppm files to take way too long. This is why the test never seems to get to the final resize test.</p>

-------------------------------------------------
<p>I would say for the horse ones there's about a 30 second or less pause, and all the others are nearly instant. I guess what I meant to ask was how do I know if it's even working? Is a new file of the name argv[2] supposed to be being created with the new image? Is that how I check? </p>

<p></p>


<p>I get the above error after make test runs (all the tests pass) and im not sure where its coming from? </p>

-------------------------------------------------
<p>This means that your resize driver program exited with a status code 1. So you probably have the error checking code returning 1 when there was in fact no error. Make sure that whenever there is no error in the parameters given from the command line, that your program calls the processing function and then exits via `return 0`.</p>

After changing Matrix Column to respect the interface, test matrix column does not pass matrix_test.
<p>As stated above, Matrix Column does not seem to pass matrix _test after changing it to respect the interface.</p>


<p></p>


<p>In ASSERT_EQUAL(Matrix_column(mat, ptr), column), line 150:<br/>0 != 4</p>


<p>this is the out put generated after running matrix_test</p>


<p></p>


<p>Matrix_coulumn seems to work in public tests perfectly fine.</p>

-------------------------------------------------
<p>It's impossible for us to tell without looking at your code. Either your test is flawed or your Matrix_column fails an edge case that the public tests didn't catch (since the public tests are not comprehensive). You can investigate both by setting a breakpoint in the test and using the debugger.</p>

<p></p>


<p>Is it possible I broke something with an incorrect resize.cpp? </p>

-------------------------------------------------
<p>Did you remember to run the "make" command? Also, check to see if you maybe accidentally modified the provided .ppm files (try re-downloading them all).<br/><br/>Also, the issue might be in one of your functions that the given rotate_left function uses. Stepping through rotate_left using the debugger may or may not help too idk</p>

-------------------------------------------------
<p>Realistically does it really matter though? Can't I just resubmit the same processing.cpp file from my previous submit that passed all the autograder tests since it's the same exact file and I don't need to submit any .ppm files</p>

-------------------------------------------------
<p>If you're 100% confident in the correctness of your processing.cpp, then sure. If you want to keep testing or modify other code, then you should try to fix it.</p>

<p></p>


<p>I am getting this error after running make test, but im not sure to identify where exactly it is coming from or what this error means? I know something must be failing with resize because all processing tests pass, im just not sure what. </p>

-------------------------------------------------
<p>It runs resize with dog.ppm and checks to see if it outputs the proper file. The file your resize created didn't match the correct solution. It marked every single line so it looks like either your file isn't being created at all or it's completely empty.</p>

Here's a tip for using GIMP with vscode
<div class="markdown" id="q38kRj58oo0ooY"><p>You can drag .ppm files from VSCode’s folder viewer (“Explorer”) to an open GIMP window to immediately open the .ppm file in GIMP. Super useful alongside using gdb for debugging processing.cpp; for example you can compare pixel values from the image using GIMP to pixel values read using your <code>Image_init(img*, filestream)</code> function using the debugger [to see if you swapped the width and height in the for loop in <code>Image_init()</code> like I did] 😉</p></div>

energy matrix
<p>How do you compute an energy matrix if there is only 1 row or column?</p>

-------------------------------------------------
<p>I don't think you can.</p>


<p></p>


<p>Edit: see instructor's answer</p>

-------------------------------------------------
<p>This case shouldn't really even happen because if there's only 1 row or column and you're running a seam carve, the end height/width would be 0, which isn't allowed. However, this isn't part of the requires clause of compute_energy_matrix(), so it's not a bad idea to check for this case.</p>


<p></p>


<p>1. Fill it with zeros. This should give you a 1xn or nx1 matrix with all 0's.</p>


<p></p>


<p>2. Compute the energy for each non-border pixel. All pixels are on the border, so we can skip this.</p>


<p></p>


<p>3. Find the maximum energy so far (which is 0), and use it to fill the border pixels. Again, all of the pixels are on the border, so we set them to 0.</p>


<p></p>


<p>In the end, the energy matrix should just be filled with 0's.</p>

Resize failing compiler and included headers test on autograder
<p>Hi,</p>


<p>my partner and I have just finished resize.cpp. it passes the public test in the autograder but fails on the complier and included headers. When I click on them, they both present this warning, which they state they are taking as errors (I assume this is why we are not getting any points for these parts despite it passing the public tests). Does this mean that our if statement conditions, which were originally set up like x&lt;y&lt;=z should be split up like x&lt;y &amp;&amp; y&lt;=z. We just want to make sure this is what this means because the project is due tonight and we have 2 submits left.

-------------------------------------------------
<div class="markdown" id="q38kRj58oo0ooY"><p>Your intuition on where the issue is possible. It seems like the numbers being outputted are not even close to the integers (0 or 255) that we expect them to be, however they are not pointers (these will print starting with 0x). This seems like the image’s r, g, and b channel matrices are never properly being set.</p>
<p>Make sure that when you transfer <code>is</code> stream values to the matrices, you are dereferencing the <code>Matrix_at()</code> value. <code>Matrix_at()</code> returns a pointer to the integer you want to change, so just performing <code>is &gt;&gt; Matrix_at(r_channel, x, y)</code> will not change the actual value associated with the matrix cell at row x and column y.</p>
<p>I also recommend placing a breakpoint in your image_init() and image_print() functions so you can follow the program flow line by line and monitor where variable values are not what you expect.</p>

how to fix timed out error
<p>my test keeps timing out on horses_cost and i'm not sure why, i went through and commented out all of my asserts for the functions i call in cost to see if that was the problem but it still timed out. i have been looking through my code and i'm doing exactly what the spec says to do, i don't think i'm looping through anything unnecessary, if anyone has any other suggestions i would appreciate it.</p>

-------------------------------------------------
<p>I was having the same problem. I had deep nesting in my Matrix_column_of_min_value_in_row function and fixing this solved my timed out error. From my understanding, it times out if a function is taking too long to execute, and having too many for loops, if statements, etc. causes it to take too long.</p>

crabster find seam
<p>Hi! <br/>I am failing the crabster find_seam test. I went through the code 1000 times now, but I can´t find any bugs etc. Does anyone have an advice what I should be looking out for? Common mistakes, edge cases etc.</p>


<p><br/>Thank you so much!</p>

-------------------------------------------------
<p>If you’ve already followed your code through the debugger and it does what you expect (which ends up being wrong), then perhaps your understanding of the seam function’s intended behavior is wrong.</p>


<p></p>


<p>I misunderstood this function at first as well. As detailed in the spec <a href="https://eecs280staff.github.io/p2-cv/#minimal-vertical-seam" rel="noreferrer" target="_blank">here</a>, the bounds for finding the minimum cost actually change depending on which column the minimum was in for the previously parsed row. Although the diagram in the spec does not deviate much from the initial minimum being in the 3rd column, it would be possible to have a minimum seam cross in a diagonal direction across an image.</p>


<p></p>


<p>Here is another diagram illustrating this: </p>


<p>The circles are the minimum value found in the inclusive bounds, and the boxes are the corresponding new bounds for the next row's analysis.</p>


<p></p>


<p>Another common mistake is not using bounds that span from n-1 to n+2 to account for the fact that the matrix minimum column function has an inclusive lower bound and and exclusive upper bound. <br/><br/></p>


<p>I hope this helps!</p>


<p></p>

Seam_carve test for crabster & horses
<p>Hello,</p>


<p></p>


<p>I am having an issue where I run the processing_public_tests and seam_carve() is failing for crabster. This is confusing, not really sure how to debug because the pixels are only compared at the end when they've all been printed. Super weird that all the other functions work on crabster, but it fails at seam_carve(). I did use sdiff to compare my output of crabster to the correct output and it does seem like the numbers are off. I'm not sure why that is but please let me know what I should check for or look for!!</p>


<p></p>


<p>Thanks!!</p>

-------------------------------------------------
<p>The one big thing I see is that you're using the min() function with 3 arguments, which doesn't actually work since it only works with 2 arguments to take the minimum of. If you include a third argument, it actually has to be a comparator (more on what that is later this semester).</p>


<p></p>


<p>To fix this, see if you can use the Matrix_column_of_min_value_in_row() function.</p>

-------------------------------------------------
<p>Hi, sorry I've vastly improved my code since my last submission so I know that was the wrong idea. I still have this issue!! I can submit right now and you can take a look at my code.</p>

<p>No idea what this error means and I have tried to go through many times and I have no idea how to fix it.</p>

-------------------------------------------------
<p>I would recommend stepping through your seam or seam_carve() functions with the debugger to see exactly on which line(s) your code fails.</p>


<p><br/>This will isolate exactly which line is causing the issue and you can investigate what other function(s) are buggy.</p>

horse test time
<p>Hi! </p>


<p>My horse public_tests have been running for at least 10-15 minutes now. Should I stop it and troubleshoot why or is it normal?<br/><br/>It is the seam_carve 300x382 test that I am stuck on.</p>

-------------------------------------------------
<p>Yes, you should troubleshoot it because the autograder only allows 30-60 seconds per test. Horse typically takes longer than other tests but it shouldn’t be that long.</p>


<p></p>


<p>Sometimes you might be calling helper functions meant to "respect the interface" within the actually interface they are meant to protect, which is not the use for then. This can really take up a ton of time if the function is called a bunch - think about how much longer it takes for your computer to access a value of class through a function then just by directly calling it (it can be around 2-3x slower!) That being said, do NOT go and replace these functions by just calling the values in places you aren't supposed to (eg other interfaces) to just save time. It's poor practice and the autograder will complain.</p>

-------------------------------------------------
<p>What could be common issues for long runtimes? because all my horse tests actually need at least 1 minute to get processed - even the very simple ones like rotating</p>

-------------------------------------------------
<p>Does it take this long the CAEN system? If your computer is slow then that may be the cause. Double check the time it takes on the same system the AG runs on.</p>

Image_get_pixel taking too long to run

<p>My Image_get_pixel is drastically slowing down my code. All of our processing public tests are passing, however very slowly (crabster takes two minutes, and each removed seam in horses takes a minute). Is anyone else experiencing this issue? I don't know how we can further simplify our Image_get_pixel function. Getting rid of the asserts isn't helping, either. I'm afraid that our public tests will time out in autograder.</p>


<p></p>

-------------------------------------------------
Image get pixel and matrix at should both not use any iteration.

-------------------------------------------------
<p>It might not even be that Image_get_pixel() is taking that long. It could be that you're calling it too often by iterating over pixels that you don't have to iterate over, or you're iterating over a bunch of pixels multiple times.</p>


<p></p>


<p>I also don't recommend removing the assert statements, since that is likely not the issue, and it should help in debugging.</p>

-------------------------------------------------
<p>I'm not using any iteration in either of those functions (nor in any init function).</p>

<p>Yes, you should initialize the channels in the other init function, but it looks like you're already doing that when you call the first Image_init() function.</p>

<p>It's also interesting that your submission from last night passed most of the test cases that you're currently failing. Have you checked the changes that you made to see if something's off?</p>

I would recommend either using a visual debugger or printing out the arrays in order to view the differences between your array and the expected one.</p>

<p>What does this mean/how can I fix it? Also, no, I'm not missing any semicolons in Matrix.cpp</p>

-------------------------------------------------
<p>Are you returning values from each non-void function? Are you missing any curly braces? You also may be missing a semicolon. Just look out for syntax errors that you may have missed.</p>

-------------------------------------------------
<p>Very likely you missed some curly braces. If you use clean indentation, it should be easier for you to find out where you missed the curly braces.</p>

mutation test suites
<p>Hello, </p>


<p></p>


<p>About the tests we write for the mutation tests suites, are we also supposed to intentionally write test cases that would fail on proper code, but work for the buggy implementation? </p>


<p></p>


<p>Say for example something like declaring a matrix with an invalid width/height value?</p>


<p></p>

-------------------------------------------------
<p>You are supposed to write tests using valid input and compare the output of the functions to the expected output using assert statments. If the output of the functions is not what it should be, the assert statments should fail, successfully flagging a buggy program as being inaccurate.</p>

Remove_seam function correct until it is passed back
Hello.  When I compute remove_seam in the debugger, it shows the correct answer inside the function remove_seam. However, as soon as I am out of the function, the Image removed_img is not correct. It goes back to its old width, even though the width was correct inside the function. It looks completely correct other than copying one more column of pixels than it should. It even includes 4 as the width at the top of the PPM file. Does anyone know what might be going on?

-------------------------------------------------
Are you copying the removed image back to the original image using *img = *removed_img ?
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Yes, I am.

-------------------------------------------------
<p>When you are out of the function, it doesn't matter whether removed_img is correct because it was only a temporary image created for the function. It should even be deleted at the end of the function. What matters is if the image passed to the function has the seam properly removed. Does this answer your question?</p>

-------------------------------------------------
The function removes the seam from img. img can not be passed to the function with the seam already removed so I'm not sure what you mean.

-------------------------------------------------
<p>I am confused what you mean by "img can not be passed to the function with the seam already removed" I'm not sure what that is in reference to. If you want to remove more than one seam, like you need to in your seam carve functions, the image will be passed to the function after the previous seam has been removed. </p>

Long Lines
Does just pressing enter and breaking a line up into 2 get rid of the long line error in autograder?

-------------------------------------------------
<p>Yes. In C++ you can break up lines anywhere you can put a space.</p>

-------------------------------------------------
<p>Yes you can, but you may notice that this will increase the length of the function (so you may have long functions). If you cannot fix it by simply splitting it into 2 lines, think if it is reasonable to take some code out from the function and make the code another helper function.</p>

-------------------------------------------------
If I click enter to make a new line within the parameters, should i make the new line before or after the comma?

-------------------------------------------------
<p>I think both work. </p>

-------------------------------------------------
<div class="markdown" id="q38kRj58oo0ooY"><p>Generally, it makes more sense to put the new line after the comma, since a comma signifiies a natural pause in English, and starting a line with a pause is unnatural (granted, this isn’t exactly English, but it has similar rationale). The <a href="https://google.github.io/styleguide/cppguide.html#Function_Declarations_and_Definitions" rel="noreferrer" target="_blank">google style guide</a> also suggests putting the new line after the comma.</p></div>

<p>The seam carve function depends upon the seam carve width and seam carve height. I'd recommend double checking the conditions in each of those functions, especially seam carve width (since it is used in multiple functions). It is possible that it could be causing issues.</p>

Horses.ppm cost keeps timing out on autograder.
<p>I would really like some help with identifying where my code is taking the longest. My code passes crabster.ppm very quickly, but horses.ppm times out on compute_vertical_cost_matrix. I'm having trouble determining where I'm being inefficient; every function I look at already seems to be doing its job the simplest way. </p>


<p></p>


<p>I suspect it might be my Matrix_min_value_in_row, which has two (non-nested) for loops, but only one of them will run in a given call. since the function is exclusive of column_end, i have an if-statement that runs a different loop if the column_end is exactly one less than the width of the matrix to allow me to compute cost for the second-to-last column of a cost matrix.</p>


<p></p>


<p>If any instructor is able to check the code I submitted to the autograder, that would be super appreciated.</p>

-------------------------------------------------
<p>Try using the <a href="https://eecs280staff.github.io/p2-cv/perf.html" rel="noreferrer" target="_blank">perf utility</a>, which should help you find exactly what function is causing the slowdown.

<p>Hi when my debugger step over const int blue, i get some undefined value for it, is this normal or...?<img alt="" height="545" src="/redirect/s3?bucket=uploads&amp;prefix=paste%2Fksxfxo1r1f877a%2Fc749aef5521c6061764c9a88aeab083ccef43631981cfc2103a1e154127067fd%2FScreen_Shot_2022-09-28_at_6.32.26_PM.png" width="1594"/></p>

<p>If you are not initializing the pixel's members then this is what would happen. If you are initializing them it should reflect the information that you entered inside of them.</p>

Error in cost function
<p>Me and my partner have our cost function and it supposedly passes all of the processing public tests. But it gives out this error code and i think its stopping the code from performing anything else, any idea how to fix it?</p>

Resize assertion error
<p>My autograder keeps giving me this error whenever I try to run resize and I'm not sure why : resize.exe: Matrix.cpp:16: void Matrix_init(Matrix*, int, int): Assertion `0 &lt; width &amp;&amp; width &lt;= MAX_MATRIX_WIDTH' failed.</p>

-------------------------------------------------
<div class="markdown" id="q38kRj58oo0ooY"><p>Might not be applicable anymore since the project is past due, but this is usually because <code>width</code> is set to an absurdly large integer since it was grabbed from unitialized data.</p></div>

-------------------------------------------------
It looks like maybe line 480 of Matrix_tests.cpp uses an ASSERT_EQUAL with incomparable parameters. Check that whatever 2 parameters you provide have the same type.

Everything works except Crabster 70x35
<p>Everything works except for seam carving crabster down 70x35. Every public test passes except for that one. Horses fully passes, dog fully passes, every other crabster public test fully passes. The only error output I'm getting is the failed ASSERT that the correct image and the carved image I produced are not the same.</p>


<p></p>


<p>(Assertion `Image_equal(carved_img, carved_img_correct)' failed.)</p>


<p></p>


<p>I can't figure out anything wrong - Autograder isn't helpful because all it says is the failed ASSERT as well -- visually debugging does nothing because it's just a slew of numbers that mean nothing to me and I can't manually find which ones are wrong. </p>


<p></p>


<p>I'm just at a bit of a loss as to how to even approach debugging this. Does anyone have any sort of idea what could be wrong/ how to try and debug this?</p>


<p></p>


<p>I know the FAQ says Crabster catches more edge cases but I've been working on this for hours with no progress or even a clue as to what is going wrong. </p>


<p></p>


<p>Thanks, sorry for the late frantic post.</p>

-------------------------------------------------
<p>(assuming your matrix and image functions work) You should look very closely on how you are handling the seam carving of your image. Very carefully. Take another look at the spec example of how carving works and double check all processing functions to prove to yourself that the functions are handling each edge case exactly as it is supposed to. Draw it out, may seem tedious but for some bugs this is the only way to find them.</p>

Respecting the interface in image_tests.cpp
<p>How can I find the height of an image channel (i.e. red_channel) in the image_tests.cpp if </p>


<p>img-&gt;red_channel breaks the interface? </p>

-------------------------------------------------
<p>Matrix_height(img-&gt;red_channel) shouldn't break the interface, but something like img-&gt;red_channel-&gt;height probably would</p>

Getting very large image for seam removal.
<div>
<div>void remove_vertical_seam(Image* img, const int seam[]) {</div>
<div>  Image* aux = new Image;</div>
<div>  Image_init(aux, MAX_MATRIX_WIDTH, MAX_MATRIX_HEIGHT);</div>
<div>  for (int i = 0; i &lt; Image_height(img); ++i) {</div>
<div>    for (int j = 0; j &lt; Image_width(img); ++j) {</div>
<div>      if (j &lt; seam[i]){</div>
<div>        Image_set_pixel(aux, i, j, Image_get_pixel(img, i, j));</div>
<div>      }</div>
<div>      if (j &gt; seam[i]) {</div>
<div>        Image_set_pixel(aux, i, j-1, Image_get_pixel(img, i, j));</div>
<div>      }</div>
<br/>
<div>  }</div>
<div>  *img = *aux;</div><br/><div>  delete aux;</div>
<div>}</div>
<div>}</div>
<div></div>
<div>So we are trying to remove the seam of our image, but we seem to be getting an infinitely large image filled with 0 0 0 pixels. We aren't quite sure why we are getting such a large image, so any help would be appreciated.</div>
</div>

-------------------------------------------------
<p>I think the problem is here: Image_init(aux, MAX_MATRIX_WIDTH, MAX_MATRIX_HEIGHT); You would have to initialize aux to be the same height as the image and width should be 1 less than the image width since your taking out a seam</p>

-------------------------------------------------
<div>
<div>void Image_set_pixel(Image* img, int row, int column, Pixel color) {</div>
<br/>
<div>  int* red = Matrix_at(&amp;img-&gt;red_channel, row, column);</div>
<div>  int* green = Matrix_at(&amp;img-&gt;green_channel, row, column);</div>
<div>  int* blue = Matrix_at(&amp;img-&gt;blue_channel, row, column);  </div>
<div>  *red = color.r;</div>
<div>  *green = color.g;</div>
<div>  *blue = color.b;</div>
</div>


<p>This is what our image_set_pixel looks like for reference, but I am not sure if this is what is causing the error. Any hint or assistance would be of great use to us.</p>

<p>I did end up trying that, but it didn't seem to help in the end.</p>

C++ book reccomendation?
<p>I feel like I am able to internalize concepts when learning better when I read. There are tons of c++ books, but I was wondering if there is a book you teach from or would recommend I look at specifically for this course? </p>

-------------------------------------------------
For this course, the “textbook” linked on the website is sufficient.
<div><br/></div>
<div>I felt like my comprehension of C++ data structures grew immensely in EECS 281 with their textbook (<a href="https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/17_OxBJ93t3BkiKfXpefbYtht1CBDutuc" rel="noreferrer" target="_blank">https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/17_OxBJ93t3BkiKfXpefbYtht1CBDutuc</a>).</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>Right now I am enjoying the EECS 482 textbook “Three Easy Pieces” which covers much deeper OS concepts. (<a href="https://pages.cs.wisc.edu/~remzi/OSTEP/" rel="noreferrer" target="_blank">https://pages.cs.wisc.edu/~remzi/OSTEP/</a>).</div>

-------------------------------------------------
<p>is the reading for EECS 281 required? also do you know if EECS 370 or 376 have readings</p>

-------------------------------------------------
For this class no, and it’s not required if you take 281 either. I don’t  recall 370s recommended textbook being useful.

Question about projects
<p>Generally how should we approach doing projects so that we aren't stuck with a bunch of bugs and errors in the end of the program? Any advice?</p>

-------------------------------------------------
<div class="markdown" id="q38kRj58oo0ooY"><p>Pretend the due date is a week before it actually is. Debug each program step by step, and sometimes you have to start testing with one function at a time, or even one block of code. If you aren’t sure what your loop or function will do, it doesn’t hurt to isolate that, put it into the main function, and let it run to see before you bury it with the rest of your code.</p>
<p>Also, read through the specs <strong>carefully</strong>. Make sure that you are programming for the right behaviors, and it may help to even grab a pen and paper and <em>be the computer</em>. Feel how the procedure will run, and then you can catch weird behaviors/edge cases you may think of along the way.</p></div>

-------------------------------------------------
<p>I agree 100%, you should never plan to finish a project the day before it's due, plan to finish at least a few days before. No matter how fast you code, you'll never really know how many bugs you have and how long they will take to fix, so your best bet is to start early (as early as the first day a project is released even) and best part is if you get stuck chances are someone in OH can help as supposed to the last couple days before a project is due.</p>

<p>You'd be surprised how much easier it is to code and how many bugs you'll avoid if you write and test code little by little :)</p>

write test cases for checking the REQUIRES clause.
<p>Hi, I want ask how we could test the REQUIRES clause in our test.cpp. For example, I want to assert that the code will fail to compile in this case. How to assert that? Should I write assert (false)? Thank you so much!</p>

-------------------------------------------------
<p>You can write an assert statement at the beginning of the function if you want, but basically, as long as you don't use test inputs that would validate the requires clause, you don't need to write test cases for it.</p>

P3 FAQ
<p>Refer to this post for Frequently Asked Questions on Project 3. Project 3 <strong>CHECKPOINT</strong> will be due on <strong>Monday, October 10 at 8pm EST</strong>. Project 3 (full project) will be due on <strong>Friday, October 21 at 8pm EST</strong>.

<h1>From the FAQ:</h1>


<p><strong>Q: I’ve never played Euchre before, how do I learn the rules of the game?</strong></p>


<p></p>


<p>A: Pages 2-5 of the spec detail the rules of “EECS 280 Euchre”. Also, a staff member from prior semesters made a video tutorial a few years ago that may be helpful: <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M0jGJ0NRcrc" rel="noreferrer" target="_blank">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M0jGJ0NRcrc</a></p>

<p></p>


<p>There will also be a euchre social on <strong>October 1st from 12 - 2 pm</strong> where you can get one-on-one help from IAs to learn euchre.</p>


<p></p>


<p><strong>Q: What do I have to submit to pass the checkpoint?</strong></p>


<p></p>


<p>The checkpoint includes all the files except the driver (<code>Card.cpp</code>, <code>Card_tests.cpp</code>, <code>Pack.cpp</code>, <code>Player.cpp</code>, <code>Player_tests.cpp</code>). It will make up 0.5% of your overall course grade.</p>


<p></p>


<p><strong>Q: Can I add helper functions while implementing the Player classes?</strong></p>


<p><strong></strong></p>


<p>You are allowed to use helper functions, but these helper functions should not change the interface of the class. So within your implementations of the class’s member functions, feel free to call helpers. But in your test files, you should not assume that these functions exist (because you should not alter the interface for the classes). This also applies in your euchre driver as well! e.g. If you add a helper function to the simple player class, you can use it within that class, but you can’t use it in the driver since it won’t be part of the Player interface!</p>


<p></p>


<p>This is especially important because when we run your test cases against an intentionally buggy solution, that solution will not have your specially defined helper functions! So just use the interfaces of each class when you test them.</p>


<p></p>


<p><strong>Q: Why am I getting a compiler error for calling sort?</strong></p>


<p></p>


<p>Note that the sort function modifies the hand. You cannot modify member variables in a const function, so you’ll receive a compiler error you call sort in a const member function.</p>


<p></p>


<p>You shouldn’t need to sort using card less. When you print the hand in order it should be sorted using the &lt; operator. You could sort with card less when determining what action to take, but you should be able to find the min/max card in the hand without sorting. You could use a functor to sort using card less, but those are only covered later in the course. Generally: if you need to use sort, just the default one will be fine.</p>


<p></p>


<p>Similarly: <strong>Q: I’m getting a compiler error related to swap?</strong></p>


<p></p>


<p>This is the same question as the one above.  Use <a data-pats="post_ref" href="1781" onclick="return PE.gotoPost('1781');">@1781</a> to direct students</p>


<p></p>


<p><strong>Q: Why am I passing euchre public test, but failing euchre public test with solution card, pack, and player?</strong></p>


<p></p>


<p>This means that when your euchre.cpp is run with the instructor solution implementations of card, pack, and player you produce incorrect output. This likely means that you’re making an incorrect assumption about what functionality should go in card/pack/player versus in the game of euchre. For example, make sure that you’re not printing output in player.cpp that should be printed in euchre.cpp.</p>


<p></p>


<p><strong>Q: Why won’t pack.in open in pack public tests when running on Xcode?</strong></p>


<p></p>


<p>Click on the name of your scheme in the toolbar at the top left, Edit Scheme &gt; Options &gt; Enable “Custom Working Directory” and press the little folder icon. Pick the folder that contains your code along with pack.in. This will ensure that the file is visible to your executable. This is usually not a problem, and we are investigating the issue.</p>


<p></p>


<p><strong>Q: How do I debug and add in command line arguments with XCode/VSCode/VS?</strong></p>


<p></p>


<p>Follow <a href="https://eecs280staff.github.io/p1-stats/setup.html#visual-debugger" rel="noreferrer" target="_blank">this link</a>  and click on your specific IDE, then click on the “Arguments and options” subsection.</p>


<p></p>


<p><strong>Q: Should I be printing the incoming arguments from the command line?</strong></p>


<p></p>


<p>Yes, according to the spec: “First, print the executable and all arguments on the first line. Print a single space at the end, which makes it easier to print an array.”</p>


<p></p>


<p><strong>Q: Do I need to worry about the human player doing (insert illegal move) during the game?</strong></p>


<p></p>


<p>No, in accordance with the spec you can assume that a human player will follow the rules of the game and will not attempt to cheat.</p>

Questions about the unit test framework
<p>Hi, I want to ask do we have to use the unit test strcture for the matrix_test and image_tests? Can we use assert functions for theses tests instead? Thank you so much!</p>

-------------------------------------------------
<p>Yea according to spec, </p>


<p>"You must write and submit tests for the Matrix and Image classes. Your test cases MUST use the unit test framework, otherwise the autograder will not be able to evaluate them. You are limited to a maximum of 50 TEST() functions per file."<br/>https://eecs280staff.github.io/p2-cv/#unit-testing-framework</p>

Questions about the  the json file.
<p>Hi, there are two .json files, one is I created and the other is automatically appears in my p2 file. Should I directly use the .json file in p2 and replace the contents here? Thank you!</p>


<p><img alt="image.png" src="/redirect/s3?bucket=uploads&amp;prefix=paste%2Fl7zih2mbmcf5j%2F7d6118ccae1196095dd45198549749e11c423efcff89676f4a6fd11f69d8442a%2Fimage.png"/></p>

-------------------------------------------------
<p>This is because you opened a different root folder, and VScode will automatically create a .json file in your root folder. I suggest when you are working with, for example project 2, just open the project 2 folder instead of the whole eecs280 folder :).</p>

testing codes by ourselves.
<p>Hi, I want to ask how we could test the codes by ourselves effectively. Is making files in Ubantu enough for cathing bug? Or we should set up CEAN for this? I tried to set up CEAN by the tutorial, but I didn't received the account of CEAN. I took 183 in another institution, is that the problem? Thank you!</p>

-------------------------------------------------

Questions about the multiple test cases.
<p>Hi, I tried to set different cases for testing, but when I tried to delete the new matrix and redefined it, an error message showed up. Should I use different name for each case? Thank you!</p>


<p></p>


<p><img alt="image.png" src="/redirect/s3?bucket=uploads&amp;prefix=paste%2Fl7zih2mbmcf5j%2Fcbcbfc9035e224f0111f8ee305ded36817bff717d3334ada69d8025e8dcf5b3b%2Fimage.png"/></p>

-------------------------------------------------
<p>Are you trying to redeclare it withing the same function? Even though mat is going to be deleted first, the compiler doesn't know that, so you have to choose another name for mat when you redeclare it the second time</p>

-------------------------------------------------
<p>Thank you! Yes. I tried to make up different cases, so I redefined it in the same function. Should I use a different name for the variable or use a different function?</p>

-------------------------------------------------
<div class="markdown" id="q38kRj58oo0ooY"><p>You can use a different name or change the currently existing <code>mat</code> object</p></div>

P2 Image_tests.cpp error with ASSERT_EQUAL()!
<p>I'm currently working on project 2 and keep coming up with this error when trying to run an</p>


<div>
<div>ASSERT_EQUAL(Image_get_pixel(img, 1, 1), white);</div>
<div>in my Image_tests.cpp file. Unfortunately, ubuntu/terminal gives me this error message:</div>

<div>I believe this is an issue with Image_get_pixel returning a Pixel but <strong>white</strong>, which I initialized as a Pixel, for some reason is being treated as an address to a Pixel. Not sure why this is happening but I can't get Image_tests.cpp to compile without this being fixed, any ideas on why this is happening?</div>
</div>

-------------------------------------------------
<p>Maybe instead of comparing the structs, try comparing all the members between each struct. </p>


<p></p>


<p>assert(Image_get_Pixel(img, 0, 0).r == White.r);</p>


<p>assert(Image_get_Pixel(img, 0, 0).g == White.g);</p>

arm64 error

<p>My partner and I followed the steps in the P3 spec to compile but are getting this error. We double checked to make sure we aren't doubly including files at the top of what we made, and we added the project id to the files we made. What could be wrong?</p>


<p></p>


<p>Thanks!<a href="/redirect/s3?bucket=uploads&amp;prefix=paste%2Fksxhnjvarkr6zu%2F784917f1ec67b96532a05974787c57b09fca9fa75e0036f0a1c77361b1da0472%2FScreen_Shot_2022-09-29_at_7.27.32_PM.png" rel="noreferrer" target="_blank">Screen_Shot_2022-09-29_at_7.27.32_PM.png</a></p>

<p>It seems that you might be missing your function stubs for those functions listed. The compiler is looking for those declarations in Card.cpp but isn't finding them.</p>

<div>Is this wrong and causing the arm64 error?</div>

<div class="markdown" id="q38kRj58oo0ooY"><p><code>-&gt;</code> is equivalent to dereferencing <code>*</code> and then using the dot operator <code>.</code> to access the attribute of the object. Thus, you use <code>-&gt;</code> on a pointer to a struct or class object.

Matrix_print failing and propagating
<p>Hi, my partner and I have an extension on Project 2 but we are still really struggling to actually get the functions to work as we effectively have had to do this project in 48hrs. </p>


<p></p>


<p>When I run Matrix_print the output looks to me to be identical, but it still fails on the public test. I really don't know why this is!</p>


<p></p>


<p>Currently, mine looks like this:</p>


<div>
<div>void Matrix_print(const Matrix* mat, std::ostream&amp; os) {</div>
<br/><br/>
<div>os &lt;&lt; mat -&gt; width &lt;&lt; " " &lt;&lt; mat -&gt; height &lt;&lt; endl;</div>
<div>for (int i = 0; i &lt; mat -&gt; height; i++) {</div>
<div>for (int j = 0; j &lt; mat -&gt; width; j++) {</div>
<div>os &lt;&lt; *Matrix_at(mat, i, j) &lt;&lt; " " &lt;&lt; endl;</div>
<div>}</div>
<br/>
<div>os &lt;&lt; '\n' &lt;&lt; endl;</div>
<br/>
<div>}</div>
</div>


<div>and outputs this:</div>


<div>** Test case "test_matrix_print": FAIL<br/>In ASSERT_EQUAL(expected.str(), actual.str()), line 55:<br/>1 1<br/>42 <br/> != 1 1<br/>42 </div>



<div>We are pretty behind so we would appreciate all of the help we can get!</div>



<div>Thank you so much!</div>


<div></div>

-------------------------------------------------
<p>Looks like a whitespace or endl issue, mostly likely this:</p>


<p></p>


<p>os &lt;&lt; *Matrix_at(mat, i, j) &lt;&lt; " " &lt;&lt; endl;</p>


<p></p>


<p>should actually be this: os &lt;&lt; *Matrix_at(mat, i, j) &lt;&lt; " ";</p>

<p>It still fails with the same output - I recompiled and everything...</p>

"Does not consider trump"
<p>I'm confused about how to ignore the trump suit when there is no member variable that tells us which suit is the trump.</p>


<p>For instance, how do we determine which suit to return in Card::get_suit(const std::string &amp;trump) when we don't have a pre-set value for trump?</p>

-------------------------------------------------
<p>I think what your asking about is Card::get_suit(), not Card::get_suit(const std::string &amp;trump). In the example of Card::get_suit(), we don't want to consider trump, meaning that whatever the suit the card is, that is what we want to return. </p>


<p></p>


<p>Now say we have Card::get_suit(const std::string &amp;trump), where &amp;trump is passed in and we <strong>do</strong> want to consider trump, then there is 1 case where we don't want to return the "exact" suit of the card.</p>


<p></p>


<p>This 1 case is when we are looking at the left bower. </p>


<p></p>


<p>Let's say the trump suit is Hearts, in this case, the left-bower would be Jack-of-Diamonds.</p>


<p></p>


<p>Technically, what is the suit of Jack-of-Diamonds? (The suit is Diamonds)</p>


<p></p>


<p>buttttt since this is the left bower, we want to consider the suit to be hearts, so that's what Card::get_suit(const std::string &amp;trump) would return.</p>


<p></p>


<p>Again, in the case when we call the function Card::get_suit() on the left bower (Jack-of-Diamonds), then we'll just return Diamonds since we're not considering trump for this function.</p>

-------------------------------------------------
<p>That makes total sense. Thanks so much!</p>

-------------------------------------------------
<p>In this case, would you modify the left bower of the card to change to the trump suit, or would you simply return the trump suit for this card?</p>

How many bugs are there to expose?
<p>In <a data-pats="post_ref" href="1107" onclick="return PE.gotoPost('1107');">@1107</a>, someone asked the same question for project 2. Now, for project 3, how many possible bugs can we expose in <kbd>Card_tests</kbd> and <kbd>Player_tests</kbd> (so we can build more comprehensive test suites)?</p>

-------------------------------------------------
<p>Good question, I don't know the exact number, but, I know that when you submit test cases to the autograder, it tells you how many bugs you caught and how many points you got, so that should probably help know how many test cases to write. Specifically for this project, you should have at least a few test cases for every function.</p>

clangd

When I disable clangd it doesn't give me this error but it also doesn't catch errors in my code at all if I disable it. </p>

<p>Sounds like clangd might be using an older C++ standard - as constexpr was added to the language in C++11, which is the version this class uses. You would probably need to look into getting clangd to use C++11 if you want to keep using it.</p>

<div class="markdown" id="q38kRj58oo0ooY"><p>Yes, but it is typically bad practice to do so - possible conflicting names down the line and/or possible bugs. I don’t believe that the style checker checks for extra libraries.</p></div>

Card_Less function
<p>For this function, are we allowed to assume that the 2 cards passed into this function won't be the same card, its not in the RME's for this function but for the program that we're making, it wouldn't make sense if we passed the exact same card twice to this function?</p>

-------------------------------------------------
<p>No, you cannot assume that. Note that you cannot assume this for the less-than operator (<kbd>&lt;</kbd>) that we implemented—that is, the less than operator can take in two cards of the same value. If you remember this, the fact that the cards can be the same should not be prohibitive.</p>

Operator Test Cases
<p>In the specs for how to overload the operators for the card class, it says that all we have to write originally are the less than case and the equal to case and we can derive the rest from those 2 operators. For our test cases, should we only write tests for the 2 operator functions that we made originally or should we write test cases for the other 4 operators that are derived from the first 2</p>

-------------------------------------------------
<div class="markdown" id="q38kRj58oo0ooY"><p>We should test all the operators.</p></div>

P2 Style Check CAEN doesn't match autograder???
<p>Just wondering, on the style checking page it says that CAEN and the autograder have the same style checks, yet my project 2 submission into autograder didn't pass any checks for style but it passed all style checks on my CAEN environment on VSCode. Is this an issue with my IDE/Debugger, or is there any way the autograder didn't grade my files / submission correctly? And if the autograder didn't grade me correctly, could me and my partner get the style points we deserve for our code?</p>

Card.cpp modifier
<p>Card.cpp file does not contain any modifiers. I wonder if I am allowed to construct a modifier for instances of Card, allowing me to use brute force test methods for Card.cpp functions</p>

-------------------------------------------------
<p>No. Check the requirements and restrictions section. In the second entry of the table, it says that while you may "Write helper functions in <kbd>Card.cpp</kbd> and <kbd>Pack.cpp</kbd> as non-member functions in the <kbd>.cpp</kbd> files and declare them <kbd>static</kbd>," you may not "modify <kbd>.h</kbd> files." If you want a modifier on Card to be useful at all, you will need to modify <kbd>Card.h</kbd>, but this is strictly forbidden. (And violating this rule will not get you anywhere). That said, you should not need to modify <kbd>Card</kbd> objects via an explicit modifier to test all of the functions completely.</p>

<div class="markdown" id="q38kRj58oo0ooY"><p>I’m not entirely sure you what you mean. Can you elaborate? (Putting this as a followup since it doesn’t answer the student question.)</p></div>

-------------------------------------------------
<div class="markdown" id="q38kRj58oo0ooY"><p>You won’t be using cards of rank 8 or lower outside of the Card-based files. The purpose of including them in here is to give a “fuller” sense of what a Card ADT would look like.

operator overload question
When we implement operator overload, can we use the functions to get the rank and suit of the two cards and compare them directly (like lhs.get_rank() < rhs.get_rank()), or we need to compare them based on their position and size in the array?

-------------------------------------------------
<div class="markdown" id="q38kRj58oo0ooY"><p>The issue with the first method is that rank and suit are both strings, so doing a “&lt;” comparison wouldn’t give you the desired result (e.g. even though 2 &lt; 3, the string “two” is greater than the string “three”). So the key is to use their positions in the arrays.</p>
<p>As a hint though, you can call other operator overloads within each other (assuming you don’t have a recursive loop, like having == call != and vice versa)</p></div>

-------------------------------------------------
Thanks! Also, if I want to check if lhs is smaller than rhs and their ranks are equal, then I need to check their suits?

-------------------------------------------------
<p>Yes. Suits break ties of rank.</p>

-------------------------------------------------
Can you use the . operator to find the position of lhs in the array?

-------------------------------------------------
<div class="markdown" id="q38kRj58oo1ooY"><p>Unfortunately, you will have to do this manually. To find the position of the lhs &amp; rhs rank/suit in the arrays, you would have to perform element-wise comparison to determine what indices they exist at.</p></div>

Can a struct have constructor?
<p>Can a struct have a constructor? If so, why do we use Matrix_init() instead of a constructor? Thank you.</p>

-------------------------------------------------
I don’t think structs have a constructor while classes do

-------------------------------------------------
<p>Ditto Ethan's response below. Structs can have member functions, including constructors. In real-world C++ code though, we don't see structs with member functions all that often; they're mostly used for organizing multiple pieces of data into one type.</p>

-------------------------------------------------
<p>Structs are completely allowed to have a constructor - in fact, structs and classes are effectively identical to the compiler! (I believe the only actual difference is structs have public fields by default, classes have private fields)</p>


<p></p>


<p>The reason project 2 used something like <strong>Matrix_init()</strong> rather than a constructor was to teach about "old styled" C constructs rather than something more "modern" like C++ classes. All things considered - nothing was stopping you from implementing a constructor for the matrix struct - but that wasn't the purpose of the assignment.</p>

Shuffle problem
<p>I was wondering whether I have the logic correct for the shuffle function. I read the wikipedia article and I wrote the following code. First I split the deck in half. I do this by creating 2, 12 card arrays. I then refill the original array of cards by interchanging the 2 decks. For some reason, my tests fail and I am picking the wrong card at the top. Are there any holes in my logic that could be leading to this error? <img alt="Screen_Shot_2022-10-01_at_4.37.43_PM.pngNaN" src="/redirect/s3?bucket=uploads&amp;prefix=paste%2Fksy86i95wko132%2F37ab8e670d668194ba1648503a2f7a134659b2224ca43e411cc1ea2a8bf4a640%2FScreen_Shot_2022-10-01_at_4.37.43_PM.png"/></p>

-------------------------------------------------
<div class="markdown" id="q38kRj58oo0ooY"><p>Without looking too deeply at your code, my recommendation is to annotate your code with print statements that run throughout each iteration of the shuffle function, purely for debugging purposes. For example, you can <code>cout</code> “shuffle 1” followed by the state of your deck. Then, I think you’ll find that its much easier to see which iteration the function is failing on.</p></div>

trump card in card
<p>since we assumed the trump suit is the suit of the left_bower in get_suit(trump) do we also assume that for the rest of the function in card like is_right_bower()?</p>

-------------------------------------------------
<div class="markdown" id="q38kRj58oo0ooY"><p>Yes, we treat the left_bower as if it were the trump suit for every function.</p></div>

-------------------------------------------------
<p>If we treat the suit of the left bower as the trump suit in is_right_bower(), wouldn't it return true for two cards? This would cause the bowers to be of equal value, no?</p>

-------------------------------------------------
<div class="markdown" id="q38kRj58oo1ooY"><p>Sorry, that was my bad for giving a slightly inaccurate. In <code>is_right_bower()</code>, <code>is_left_bower()</code>, and all functions that state “does not consider trump” will use the suit assigned at initialization.</p></div>

-------------------------------------------------
<p>So if we use is_left_bower(trump) to be the trump suit for the implementation of function is_trump, is it wrong to then use is_trump in the implementation of is_left_bower? Thinking about it they would both just be calling each other. </p>

-------------------------------------------------
<div class="markdown" id="q38kRj58oo2ooY"><p>If you were to do this, then there’s a very high chance that you will infinite loop. One of the two functions has to not call the other.</p></div>

card operator test
<p>I am trying to test for operators. At first, I am thinking about using a for loop to create every card to test, but when it goes to two cards, I will have to use four for loops to compare between two cards, and I think that might be a problem as deep nesting, so I feel like I am in the wrong direction, maybe I should test individual cases?</p>


<p></p>


<p></p>


<p>I think the more realistic way will be testing edge cases? because if I want to test all cases, I will need to run (4*13)**2 times and even more for having trump, is that correct?</p>

-------------------------------------------------
<div class="markdown" id="q38kRj58oo0ooY"><p>Well of course, you can’t test everything and it would be a waste to try to - as you said you should focus on your edge cases. This applies to all projects - for example in p1-stats there is no way to test every single vector of doubles against your functions - instead you just test some general cases and some edge cases.</p></div>

-------------------------------------------------
<p>Your intuition is correct that using edge cases to test your operators will be a more efficient way of catching bugs than brute force for all combinations. You could still try to loop through a subset of cases for the operators as a way to try more possibilities in one test case than one at a time.</p>

-------------------------------------------------
<p>Wayne He (waning) is right to point out that best practice is to test some general cases and <em>(at least one of every distinct)</em> edge case you can think of.</p>

<p>And what does the hint mean that the left bower is the trump suit? I thought the right bower is the trump suit and the left bower is just of the same color. </p>


<p></p>


<p>Thank you!</p>

-------------------------------------------------
<div class="markdown" id="q38kRj58oo0ooY"><p>It returns the suit of the card in question. The left bower is considered the trump suit for all purposes - disregard when suit it was assigned at initialization.</p></div>

20 Shuffles to restore deck
<div class="markdown" id="q38kRj58oo0ooY"><p>If you want to test <code>shuffle()</code> in <code>pack.cpp</code>, note that it takes 20 in-shuffles to restore a deck of 24 cards. If you call <code>shuffle()</code> 20 times, your deck should be the same as what it started as.</p></div>

Can I call the same function in itself with different parameters
<p>Can I call the &lt; function within the Card_less functions with trump and led_card parameters, or will this result in an error? Similarly, can I call Card_less with just the trump parameter within Card_less with both trump and led_card parameters?</p>

-------------------------------------------------
<div class="markdown" id="q38kRj58oo0ooY"><p>Yes, you can call the <code>&lt;</code> function within the <code>Card_less</code> function, but be careful with your logic since there are cases where the <code>Card_less</code> output will differ from the <code>&lt;</code> output. You can also call the first overload (the one with three parameters) of <code>Card_less</code> from the other overload with four parameters.</p>
<p>More extensively, this applies to any function you’ll ever write - you can even call a function from itself. This is called recursion and you have to be really careful with the logic here or you can easily infinite loop. However, this isn’t relevant for right now - as far as I know Euchre doesn’t require this.</p></div>

Simple Player
<p>are we supposed to create our own private variables when making the derived class for Simple Player. For example, should we create an empty vector with each players hand? Otherwise, where do we add the card in the add_card function?</p>

bool operators
<p>For the bool operators do we need to consider all cards or just the cards in the deck (ie2s through aces) for euchre (ie 9s through aces)? And if we need to consider all cards how should we rank them?</p>

-------------------------------------------------
<div class="markdown" id="q38kRj58oo0ooY"><p>I don’t know what range exactly, but I would assume the entire deck. The rankings for the cards are detailed in the spec under the section <a href="https://eecs280staff.github.io/p3-euchre/#value-of-cards" rel="noreferrer" target="_blank">value of cards</a>. In summary,</p>
<pre><code>Diamonds &gt; Clubs &gt; Hearts &gt; Spades
</code></pre><p>and</p>
<pre><code>Ace &gt; King &gt; Queen &gt; Jack &gt; Ten &gt; Nine &gt; ... &gt; Three &gt; Two
</code></pre><p>(The order is also in the constants <code>RANK_NAMES_BY_WEIGHT</code> and <code>SUIT_NAMES_BY_WEIGHT</code> in <code>Card.h</code>)</p></div>

-------------------------------------------------
<p>Student answer is right: the overloaded operators should work on the entire deck. Utilize the RANK_NAMES_BY_WEIGHT and SUIT_NAMES_BY_WEIGHT arrays to code the overloaded operators.</p>

<p>would the if statement always return true because I am doing get_suit() and get_suit(trump).

-------------------------------------------------
<p>We know the trump suit since it's passed into the function - so would we need to call <kbd>get_suit(trump)</kbd>?</p>

Simple Player add_and_discard trump
<div class="markdown" id="q38kRj58oo0ooY"><p>For the <code>add_and_discard</code> function in Simple Player, do we assume that the suit of <code>upcard</code> is the trump when comparing Cards to determine the lowest card? Or do we use the boolean operators to compare the Cards?</p></div>

P3 FAQ Helper function clarification
<p>I just had a question regarding this excerpt from the Q&amp;A:</p>


<p></p>


<p>"But in your test files, you should not assume that these functions exist (because you should not alter the interface for the classes). This also applies in your euchre driver as well! e.g. If you add a helper function to the simple player class, you can use it within that class, but you can’t use it in the driver since it won’t be part of the Player interface!"</p>


<p></p>


<p>I've never used helper functions in this course yet, so if I make a helper function and put it in say Card_less(), does that mean I can't call/test Card_less() in Card_tests.cpp because it has a helper function that isn't part of the interface? If so how do I test any function with a helper function in it?</p>


<p></p>


<p>Thank you for clearing this up.</p>


<p></p>

-------------------------------------------------
<div class="markdown" id="q38kRj58oo0ooY"><p>If you made a helper function that you will use in <code>Card_less()</code>, you can still use <code>Card_less()</code> in <code>Card_tests.cpp</code> - it won’t be breaking the interface. What the Q&amp;A is warning about is that you can’t call the helper function you made for <code>Card_less()</code> inside of <code>Card_tests.cpp</code>.</p></div>

index of a given rank/suit from array
<p>So I know that we are supposed to use the RANK_NAMES_BY_WEIGHT and SUIT_NAMES_BY_WEIGHT arrays in the overloaded operator functions but I am not quite sure how.</p>


<p></p>


<p>Is there a way to get the index of a given rank/suit from the array?</p>


<p></p>


<p>For example can I get the index "0" by calling some built in function and giving it the array RANK_NAMES_BY_WEIGHT and "Card::SUIT_SPADES" (a string in the array)?</p>

-------------------------------------------------
<div class="markdown" id="q38kRj58oo0ooY"><ol><li>You can call <code>RANK_NAMES_BY_WEIGHT</code> and <code>SUIT_NAMES_BY_WEIGHT</code> by simply typing the keyword associated with the rank/suit you want, preceded by the Card scope resolution operator.</li></ol>
<pre><code>Card::SUIT_CLUBS
</code></pre><ol start="2"><li>You are free to do whatever you want with the <code>constexpr</code> strings, except directly modify them. If you want to create an array filled with those ranks and suits, I think its a great idea that could be implemented properly.</li></ol></div>

Player Test showing False Positive
<p>When we submit our tests for player, it showed that we had a false positive test lead card. We then deleted all our tests for test lead card but it still says we have a false positive for test lead card. Please let us know how this is possible and what we may have done wrong. Thank you!</p>

<div class="markdown" id="q38kRj58oo2ooY"><p>From looking at your submission, I would check if any of the behavior you are expecting of players is against the rules of the game. Namely, attempting to add more than 5 cards to any player’s hand violates the expectation that players have MAX_HAND_SIZE = 5. Sometimes a false positive can come from expecting players to handle actions that are against the rules.</p></div>

Lab Attendance
<p>Is there any way to excuse a lab absence because of an exam conflict? (Without counting for the 2 lab drops)</p>

-------------------------------------------------
<p>Based on the following from the syllabus it looks like you would take a lab drop. The policy is specifically intended for situations including "an official university conflict" i.e. an exam conflict.</p>


<blockquote>
<p><b>Lab Drops</b>. We drop the lowest 2 lab scores for all students. This policy is intended to cover situations in which you must miss a lab due to e.g. a planned medical procedure, an unanticipated medical or personal emergency, or an official university conflict. If (and only if) you have <i>already</i> used your two drops, you may petition for an additional drop in cases of illness or emergency. Requests will be considered on a case-by-case basis.</p>
</blockquote>

-------------------------------------------------
<div class="markdown" id="q38kRj58oo0ooY"><p>Unfortunately attendance is required for these labs, and hopefully the 2 lab drops are enough for your circumstances. If you feel that you need more than 2 excused absences, we will try to accommodate this with the Additional Lab Drop Request form on the eecs280.org website.</p>
<p>I believe the form hasn’t come out yet, if you need it immediately I would suggest emailing the staff for this.</p></div>

Pack Default Ctor
<p>For the default pack constructor, is there a way to use a nested for loop to instantiate the card objects in the pack? I have tried this in numerous ways, but they all yield run-time errors.</p>


<p></p>


<p>Based off of what we have learned in lecture so far, I used a list of Card constructor calls to instantiate the 24 cards. This works but seems cumbersome and inefficient.</p>


<p></p>


<p></p>

-------------------------------------------------
<div class="markdown" id="q38kRj58oo0ooY"><p>It is definitely possible (and what I did) to use a nested loop to construct the deck of cards for the default constructor in <code>Pack</code>, and as you said, preferrable. What run-time errors are you getting when you try to loop?</p></div>

-------------------------------------------------
<p>Resolved in follow-ups.</p>

-------------------------------------------------
<p>For those encountering the same problem, I was simply failing to adjust the size of NUM_RANK for the inner for loop since only 6 ranks of a suit are in play. For some reason, I couldn't find this with the debugger initially, but lo and behold I spotted the issue with a second look.</p>

Pack Shuffle
<p>I'm super confused on how we're supposed to shuffle the deck of cards. I looked at the wikipedia and I'm still pretty confused, thanks!</p>

-------------------------------------------------
<div class="markdown" id="q38kRj58oo0ooY"><p>In the shuffle, the deck is split exactly in half. The cards are weaved such that</p>
<ul><li>the top card of the bottom half is now the first card</li><li>the top card of the top half (original top card) is now the second card</li><li>the second card of the bottom half is now the third card</li><li>the second card of the top half is now the fourth card</li><li>…</li><li>the bottom card of the bottom half is now the twenty-third card</li><li>the bottom card of the top half is now the bottom card</li></ul></div>

-------------------------------------------------
<p>I'm having a hard time thinking about the shuffle function. In this function are the bottom and top halves face up or face down? Also am I on the right track if I plan on using a nested for loop within a loop that iterates 7 times for the 7 shuffles? </p>

-------------------------------------------------
In this, we assume every card is face down (not that it matters though since we don't really have this distinction in Card). And yes, you can write the process for doing this once and then loop it 7 times.

-------------------------------------------------
<p>Are we assuming the pack is initially sorted in ascending rank order by calling the pack default ctor beforehand? </p>

-------------------------------------------------
<p>Yes</p>

-------------------------------------------------
<p>Make sure to loop this pattern 7 times!</p>

Card_less method
<p>For both of the Card_less methods, are we also accounting for the fact that Card a and Card b could be left and right bowers or do we leave that out of the implementation?</p>

-------------------------------------------------
<div class="markdown" id="q38kRj58oo0ooY"><p>Yes, we do account for that. The point of having separate Card_less functions are so that the comparisons are more accurate with more context to the game. These functions are driving almost all of the card comparing in the game, and you can’t play euchre without knowing the bowers and their order.</p></div>

<p>Sorry for the wall of text, but I have no idea what this error means and I get it for everything. I use Xcode and I tried changing the compile sources and it still fails. I have no idea what I'm doing wrong. Before you ask "did you include Card:: before the functions stubs," yes I did.</p>

-------------------------------------------------
<p>This is similar to the undefined reference to error seen with windows (see <a data-pats="post_ref" href="1642" onclick="return PE.gotoPost('1642');">@1642</a> for more details). Have you implemented all the functions in your Card.cpp file? Because the .h file only contains function stubs, the computer knows it doesn't have any implementation. It looks for the implementation but doesn't find it, so it can't connect the implementation to the function calls in the test cases, leading to undefined symbols. </p>

-------------------------------------------------
<div class="markdown" id="q38kRj58oo0ooY"><p>Did you put <code>'include "Card.h" at the top of your </code>Card.cpp` file?</p></div>

<p>Sorry for the continued follow up for this question but I have implemented all of the functions from card.h and seem to have problems with the rank or suit names. Am I supposed to implement the stuff with RANK in my .cpp file as well? The same issue but with the suits occurs with player. I am also not sure what to take from the .h file to the .cpp files. Thank you in advance</p>

-------------------------------------------------
<p>Above was fixed^</p>

-------------------------------------------------
<p>How did you fix?</p>

-------------------------------------------------
<p>You must copy and paste the RANK and SUIT variables into your card.cpp file! Add the scope resolution "Card::" before the variable name and delete everything after the =.</p>

Player.cpp
<p>I'm a bit confused about the spec- I know 4 people play euchre, so why is there just a simple and human player to code in the spec? Is it that there are going to be different versions of the simple player through polymorphism?</p>

-------------------------------------------------
<p>There will be 3 simple players and one human player playing at a time, but all the simple players will make decisions during the game in the same way which is why we just have to code one version of a simple player.</p>

-------------------------------------------------
<p>To branch off of the student answer. You can have any grouping of 4 players. You can have all 4 simple players, all 4 human players, 2 human 2 simple, or one human 3 simple.</p>


<p></p>


<p>The simple players will all have the same code and strategy, they can all interact with each other in the driver.</p>

-------------------------------------------------
<div class="markdown" id="q38kRj58oo0ooY"><p>What is the context behind this question?</p></div>

-------------------------------------------------
<p>I’m not sure how to initialize the next private variable from the Pack class in the default Pack constructor, but also I’m confused what next is supposed to be in general</p>

-------------------------------------------------
<div class="markdown" id="q38kRj58oo1ooY"><p><code>next</code> refers to the index of the next card to be taken from the pack (the top card if you were using a real deck of cards). It starts at 0, and increases each time you deal a card because those cards are no longer in the deck.</p></div>

-------------------------------------------------
<p>so will the top card (cards index 0) be the ace of diamonds or will it be the nine of spades?</p>

-------------------------------------------------
<p>Nine of spades, since Pack contains only the subset of cards used in Euchre.</p>

-------------------------------------------------
<p>deleted</p>

-------------------------------------------------
<div>
<p>Does this mean that if we use a nested for loop for the pack default ctor, we need to increment next after each card is initialized? </p>
</div>

</div>

-------------------------------------------------
Nope, since at the end of the initialization `next` should be set to 0. Of course, you could use `next` to keep track of where you want to put the next card you're initializing, but you can also just find that in your loop with a little bit of math.

-------------------------------------------------
<p>Oh okay this makes sense. Does the same thing apply with next being set to 0 at the end of reading in for Pack::Pack(istream &amp;pack_input) ?</p>

-------------------------------------------------
<p>Yes, since you are just initializing a pack of cards and not dealing out any cards, next should be set to 0</p>

-------------------------------------------------

------------------------@1627-------------------------
Why is the default pack size in Pack.h set to 24 when a usual pack of cards is 52 cards?

-------------------------------------------------
<p>Remember that Euchre only needs 24 cards: (9, 10, J, Q, K, A) * 4 (one for each suit).</p>

is_left_bower and is_right_bower
<p>According to the spec of is_right_bower and is_left_bower, it says that return true if the card is the Jack of the trump suit, but the argument in is_left_bower and is_right_bower is trump. I am confused how do we determine the trump card, or is the argument(&amp;trump) a trump?</p>

-------------------------------------------------
<p>The parameter trump is referring to the trump suit. The right bower is the jack of the trump suit and the left bower is the jack of the suit with the same color as the trump suit.</p>

<p>I was trying to debug my <code>Pack.cpp</code>, specifically the <code>Pack(std::istream&amp; pack_input)</code> constructor. However, when I tried to step through the test case for this in <code>Pack_public_test</code>, it’s giving me an error before I even enter my constructor. This is code from the Public test case:</p>

Constructor
<p>I just watched our lecture video. As professor said, constructors would be called when we create class first time. Would the constructors be called even we did not initialize it? </p>

-------------------------------------------------

If you declare a class and never make a member of the class, the constructor will not be called.

Shuffle Function
<p>Hi, I went to office hours today and the person who helped me suggested I make a post on piazza for my problem. I am passing all the public tests for pack, but I am failing my own test for the shuffle function. I saw a post on piazza that said shuffling 20 time restores the deck so I wanted to try that, but I keep failing. There are pictures for both the shuffle function and the test I wrote; it's possible I just wrote the test wrong.</p>


<p> <img alt="" height="281" src="/redirect/s3?bucket=uploads&amp;prefix=paste%2Fkeg17mpomzy21f%2Fc7c902ea501773c267bedcdcee80d647a77a6f3241ce19aab0c7b0535813004b%2FScreen_Shot_2022-10-03_at_2.48.27_PM.png" width="465"/><img alt="" height="392" src="/redirect/s3?bucket=uploads&amp;prefix=paste%2Fkeg17mpomzy21f%2F6b3c312c19b70490ed7b69efafeb306d7df6661ef4b0f403feee1e8a4c78989c%2FScreen_Shot_2022-10-03_at_2.48.58_PM.png" width="515"/></p>

-------------------------------------------------
<p>Your for loop will run 21 times, not 20. If you want to reset the pack, have your for loop conditional be &lt; 20.</p>

-------------------------------------------------
<p>Oh I did miss that thank you. However, I fixed that and it's still off so I think I have another bug somewhere. </p>

-------------------------------------------------
<p>Which assert is failing?</p>

-------------------------------------------------
<p>The first but all of them because I've tried commenting stuff out. However, I just discovered something very strange. I put a breakpoint on the first assert statement and my card (c) and my cards array in Pack are actually right. I put a picture. So I was thinking maybe then it's my get_rank function and I stepped into it but get_rank() pulled rank 9. Absolutely no idea why my computer is returning jack. I put a picture of my memory at that breakpoint. <img alt="" height="429" src="/redirect/s3?bucket=uploads&amp;prefix=paste%2Fkeg17mpomzy21f%2F1630183e32093acf4b14e8a307f1889973a17d4b0ec1ec8e31c6f162c614d046%2FScreen_Shot_2022-10-03_at_3.27.32_PM.png" width="686"/></p>

-------------------------------------------------
<p>To add onto this, the correct suits are being returned but not the correct ranks.</p>

-------------------------------------------------
<p>Still not exactly sure what happened, but I fixed it. Thanks for the help!</p>

player tests
<p>can i copy the public tests into the player tests as a start to my testing and then add on to it?</p>


<p></p>


<p>thanks</p>

-------------------------------------------------
<p>Yes</p>

-------------------------------------------------

------------------------@1633-------------------------
were we supposed to include assert statements in our functions?
<p>Did we just need them in our tests or in our functions as well? I have heard conflicting things and want to make sure. Thanks!</p>

-------------------------------------------------
<p>In your non-test functions (so your functions in Matrix.cpp, Image.cpp, etc), you didn't need to assert anything. However, it is good practice to assert the invariants specified in the function's REQUIRES clause. While the autograder won't test your functions with inputs that break these invariants, it's possible for you to make implementation mistakes that break these invariants -- assert statements help you find these bugs!</p>

Card.cpp
<p>How do I access the rank and suit variables in the Card class to implement get_rank()  and get_suit() if they're private? Am I allowed to change them to public?</p>

-------------------------------------------------
<div class="markdown" id="q38kRj58oo0ooY"><p>Because get_rank() and get_suit() are also member functions of the Card class, they have access to <code>rank</code> and <code>suit</code> private member variables. You are unfortunately not allowed to change them to public.</p></div>

-------------------------------------------------

------------------------@1635-------------------------
get suit
<p>so in get suit(), the is_left_bower() function will always return true when u input the trump string from get suit() into the is_left_bower()?</p>

-------------------------------------------------
<div class="markdown" id="q38kRj58oo0ooY"><p>I don’t think the <code>is_left_bower()</code> function will always return true, as a card isn’t necessarily always the left bower. You are allowed to input the trump string into the <code>is_left_bower()</code> function.</p></div>

Stack Smashing Error

pack()
<p>Am I supposed to loop through the private array from the pack() function, if so how do I do it? I am just very lost on how to start this. I know I want to loop through the 24 cards and put them in order but I don't know where I am ordering them. Can someone also explain how I can use the next? I am initializing it and incrementing it in the loop but how do I connect it to the private array? Any help is appreciated. Thanks!</p>

-------------------------------------------------
<div class="markdown" id="q38kRj58oo0ooY"><p>Try looping through the values you’ll be getting from <code>RANK_NAMES_BY_WEIGHT</code> and <code>SUIT_NAMES_BY_WEIGHT</code>, creating a card for each combination and putting that in the private array for <code>Pack</code>.</p>
<p><code>next</code> tracks the index of the top card. Each time you “take” a card from the pack you are taking the card at the position of <code>next</code> and increment <code>next</code> so that it’s pointing to the next card to be taken from the top.</p></div>

-------------------------------------------------
<p>What is the "top" card? Is that the card at index 23 or index 0? Should we be setting next in our constructors to the index of the last card or the first card?</p>


<p></p>


<p>Also, in regards to "Each time you “take” a card from the pack you are taking the card at the position of <code>next</code> and increment <code>next</code> so that it’s pointing to the next card to be taken from the top." by take do you mean remove a card? In which case wouldn't we be decrementing next? or does next start at the first card in the array?</p>

-------------------------------------------------
<p>The original top card is 0 and the original bottom card is 23. The next pointer is going to increment upwards each time you "draw" a card. You should not be removing the card just incrementing next when you "take" a card.</p>

-------------------------------------------------
<p>Another clarifying question: when the RME says "resets next index to first card in pack" does this mean the "top" card? so index 0?</p>

-------------------------------------------------
<p>Yes. When you have "taken" all the cards in the deck (next is last index), then you must reset it back to the top card (index 0).</p>

Card.cpp assertion errors
<p>Hi, I'm trying to use ASSERT_EQUAL to determine if rank_in is equal to any of the suits in the requires clause, but it's giving me an error that says "identifier ASSERT_EQUAL is undefined." I did the same thing to compare suits and it's not giving me any error.</p>

-------------------------------------------------
<p><kbd>ASSERT_EQUAL</kbd> is a macro <em>(I think that's the term?)</em> that the instructors wrote for us to make our unit testing easier. It comes from the unit test framework, and it can only be used in test files. You correctly used this to compare suits in a test file. Meanwhile, in program files, we use <kbd>assert()</kbd> which comes from <kbd>#include &lt;cassert&gt;</kbd>. We use this to test whether the requires statements from the RME are true. For instance, <kbd>assert(rank == "spades" || ... )</kbd>.</p>

Card.cpp compiler error
<p>So I'm trying to compile my card.cpp file and it's returning this. It did this even when I only implemented the given function stubs with assert(false)s. How can I fix it?</p>

-------------------------------------------------
<p>Have you implemented all the functions in the error message? It looks like it isn't finding your implementation. Make sure that the function stub matches exactly. Also make sure you add "Card::" to the required functions. You add "Card::" whenever you are implementing a function outside the class even though that was defined in the class.</p>

-------------------------------------------------
Did you “#include “Card.h” in Card.cpp?

-------------------------------------------------
<p>yep, it was something totally different though, but I fixed it. Thanks though!</p>

<p><span style="text-decoration:line-through">Curious, what was it?<br/></span></p>

-------------------------------------------------
<p>I am also curious, what was it? I am having trouble with same issue and have made sure card:: is in front of every function</p>

-------------------------------------------------
that was actually my solution. I wasn’t putting Card:: in front of every function. For bools I was putting Card:: in the wrong place too if that helps.

Is it not safe to store files in linux directory?
<p>I don't know why but I lost my EECS280 folder and all files in it. Is it because files in wsl is volatile?</p>


<p>Should I make directory in my windows C drive instead of in the linux system?</p>

-------------------------------------------------
<div class="markdown" id="q38kRj58oo0ooY"><p>I don’t think that the entire filesystem in WSL is volatile - I have some files I keep there and they don’t disappear after restart, but just in case, yes it is generally safer to keep files on the windows filesystem.</p>
<p>Additionally, you should be using CAEN to test your code and it doubles as a backup server. Setting up <code>make push</code> using <a href="https://eecs280staff.github.io/p1-stats/setup_caen.html" rel="noreferrer" target="_blank">this guide</a> helps a lot. To get the files back from CAEN to your machine, just switch the order of the last two arguments to <code>rsync</code>. As another safeguard, you can also use GitLab/GitHub as a backup to both store your code and its version history.</p></div>

How should we initialize cards
<div class="markdown" id="q38kRj58oo1ooY"><p>Is it ok to use strings to initialize cards (“Ace”) or we should only use things like Card::RANK_ACE?</p></div>

-------------------------------------------------
<div class="markdown" id="q38kRj58oo0ooY"><p>It is best practice to <em>respect the interface</em> and use the <code>Card</code> <code>const</code>s to safeguard from any future changes to the internals of the <code>Card</code> class.</p></div>

-------------------------------------------------
<p>When creating cards, you should use the Card::RANK_ACE. Technically it doesn't matter, however it ensures less spelling errors which can cause big bugs in the euchre.cpp file.</p>

Card_less with led card
<p>I'm struggling a little bit with coming up with a good strategy for the Card_less function that takes in two cards, the trump suit, and the led card. My only idea is to do a bunch of if-statements for the case when trump!=ledsuit. Is this the most efficient way to do this?</p>

-------------------------------------------------
<div class="markdown" id="q38kRj58oo0ooY"><p>A valid strategy is just to have a bunch of if statements dealing with the edge cases/inconsistencies in the beginning of the function with hardcoded outputs. For example, dealing with bowers in <code>Card_less</code> kinda sucks, but there are only a couple of situations with bowers so you can make some hard-coded outputs at the beginning of the function and the rest of the data is clean and uniform.</p>

What do lhs and rhs mean?
<div>
<div>//EFFECTS Returns true if lhs is lower value than rhs.</div>
<div>//  Does not consider trump.</div>
<div>bool operator&lt;(const Card &amp;lhs, const Card &amp;rhs) {</div>
<div>assert(false);</div>
<div>}</div>
</div>



<div>My partner and I are unable to find anything online that is related to what lhs and rhs could mean in this function (and the ones that follow).</div>

-------------------------------------------------
<p>I don't know whether the instructors have named the parameters <kbd>lhs</kbd> and <kbd>rhs</kbd> for a specific reason. It doesn't have any meaning in Euchre as far as I know, and the variable names don't tell us anything at all about the implementation of <kbd>Card_less</kbd>. (I suppose <kbd>l</kbd> and <kbd>r</kbd> correspond to left and right... but it doesn't matter).</p>


<p></p>


<p>The function should return whether Card <kbd>lhs</kbd> is lower than Card <kbd>rhs</kbd> according to the spec: "In the simplest case, cards are ordered by rank (A &gt; K &gt; Q &gt; J &gt; 10 &gt; 9), with ties broken by suit (D &gt; C &gt; H &gt; S)." We could rename <kbd>lhs</kbd> and <kbd>rhs</kbd> in our function to be <kbd>Card1</kbd> and <kbd>Card2</kbd>, and it would not change anything.</p>

-------------------------------------------------
<div class="markdown" id="q38kRj58oo0ooY"><p>To add on to Matthew’s answer, <code>lhs</code> and <code>rhs</code> are standard names for operators like this - they stand for “left hand side” and “right hand side” respectively.</p></div>

UB Behavior Checks for euchre.cpp in checkpoint?
<p>In the autograder for the checkpoint, part of the checkpoint score is including UB checks for euchre.cpp. Is this a mistake considering you can't submit euchre.cpp to the checkpoint?</p>

-------------------------------------------------
<p>No. Although it checks for undefined behavior, it does not count against you if you have undefined behavior in <kbd>euchre.cpp</kbd> (or any file for that matter). The undefined behavior checks are simply there to help you identify potential mistakes in your code, including in <kbd>euchre.cpp</kbd> if you work ahead.</p>

-------------------------------------------------
<p>There are no private test cases so for the checkpoint, what score you see is the score you get. The UB checks don't have points associated to them yet so you don't those points for the checkpoint.</p>

Vscode Cannot Find gcc - How Do I Fix
<p><img alt="" height="980" src="/redirect/s3?bucket=uploads&amp;prefix=paste%2Fl8tedq352hm3pm%2Fffa81f6d2b3dbd9912aaa19e6cfb35ab9758584a0aeb60a523f920ceb9a82e63%2Ferror.png" width="1300"/>I followed the steps for setting up the starter files. However, it seems that vscode was not running on WSL Remote, and there was an error saying "cannot find gcc". I also tried opening vscode in the folders of the previous projects and it all worked, but it just wouldn't work in my project 3 folder. How do I fix this?</p>

-------------------------------------------------
<div class="markdown" id="q38kRj58oo0ooY"><p>As you mentioned, VSCode is not running on WSL which causes it to not find <code>gcc</code> (the compiler) because you likely don’t have it installed on windwos. To enter WSL, you can click on the icon in the bottom left and it should give you this popup allowing you to reopen in WSL:</p>
<p><img alt="image.png" src="/redirect/s3?bucket=uploads&amp;prefix=paste%2Fl7nv0y6f4pf5aa%2F8171f77feb980664cbc8d870dea9e74e64ded890e25eed667125d35bf7aedc9c%2Fimage.png"/></p></div>

-------------------------------------------------
<p>Can you post your launch.json file? Also make sure it follows the version given in the setup tutorial.</p>

-------------------------------------------------
<p>I am running in WSL now but the problem is still there.<img alt="" height="964" src="/redirect/s3?bucket=uploads&amp;prefix=paste%2Fl8tedq352hm3pm%2F3ba854c49d3414413d8acd66d132737a78773761719c93d8f90fca59100d5cdb%2Ferror2.png" width="1284"/></p>


<p></p>


<p></p>

-------------------------------------------------
<div class="markdown" id="q38kRj58oo1ooY"><p>Does the rest of the workflow work fine despite this (i.e. can you compile, run, etc)? In my project I don’t have a <code>c_cpp_properties.json</code> file and I haven’t seen any issues like this.</p></div>

-------------------------------------------------
<p>@Wayne The <kbd>c_cpp_properties.json </kbd>doesn't show up unless you open it. He likely opened it to follow the instructions in: <a href="https://eecs280staff.github.io/p1-stats/setup_vscode.html#intellisense" target="_blank">https://eecs280staff.github.io/p1-stats/setup_vscode.html#intellisense</a></p>

-------------------------------------------------
<p>I tried to use /usr/bin/gcc as in Ethan's code and it worked. Still curious why this is the case though.</p>

-------------------------------------------------
<p>The reason is because the compiler folder is in the /usr/bin folder. As an example, if you're hard coding in the path to an image and it's located in your desktop folder you need to specify the path is to your desktop.</p>

-------------------------------------------------
<p>Also, I noticed my compilerPath is <kbd>"/usr/bin/gcc"</kbd>, not just <kbd>"gcc"</kbd>. See below for my whole <kbd>c_cpp_properties.json</kbd> file.</p>

<p>Thank you so much, I tried to use /usr/bin/gcc instead and it worked! Any idea why this is the case?</p>

-------------------------------------------------
<div class="markdown" id="q38kRj58oo3ooY"><p><code>/usr/bin/gcc</code> is the absolute path to the <code>gcc</code> compiler. In Linux, the root directory is <code>/</code>, and every file on the system starts from this directory. Just having <code>gcc</code> as before makes the computer try to resolve the name <code>gcc</code> to a path. For some reason, your computer couldn’t determine that <code>gcc</code> was referring to the actual path <code>/usr/bin/gcc</code> so it threw the error.</p>
<p>If you’re experienced with Windows, it’s like when you run <code>code</code> the computer tries to resolve it to <code>C:\Users\[username]\AppData\Local\Programs\Microsoft VS Code\Code.exe</code>, and for some reason it lost this link. So to fix it we just put <code>C:\Users\[username]\AppData\Local\Programs\Microsoft VS Code\Code.exe</code> instead of <code>code</code>.
(fun fact: the variable which stores the linking between program names and actual locations is called your PATH and you can edit it manually)</p></div>

Do we need to check that the istream pack_input is open/isn't failing in the Pack non default ctor?

Constructors and private members in Player
<p>In Player.h all of the functions and variables in the Player class are public and I wanted to add some private variables for something like the player's name. I wasn't sure if this was allowed because I'd be editing the .h file. I just don't see how I can make constructors for my derived class is there is nothing to construct from the base class.</p>


<p></p>


<p>side note: im pretty confused on player.cpp so I might be interpreting things completely wrong</p>

-------------------------------------------------
<div class="markdown" id="q38kRj58oo0ooY"><p>You shouldn’t edit the <code>.h</code> file still, you should instead just add the private variables to your derived classes. As for the constructor, <code>Player</code> does have the default constructor, so you don’t need to add anything there - you just need to add your constructors for your derived classes.</p></div>

-------------------------------------------------
<p>Good question! I understand where the confusion is coming from. Remember that derived classes also inherit the parent classes member functions, not only their variables!  For this project, you need to create two derived classes: Simple and Human. Human takes in human input from the terminal to determine what the player does. Simple is like the computer bot that has preprogrammed decisions to make during the game. For each of these, they are going to have the same functions (add card, make trump, etc) which is why they are derived from the Player class. You must code each of these functions for both Simple and Human to ensure that the entire game can be played no matter who is playing (4 bots, 4 humans, 2 and 2, etc).</p>


<p></p>


<p>Hope this helps!</p>

-------------------------------------------------
<p>@stoneann @waning </p>


<p>Since both HumanPlayer and SimplePlayer require private variables and <em>string name</em> and <em>vector&lt;Card&gt; hand</em>, why does the base Player class not declare these variables that are common among its derived classes? i.e, why do we have to write duplicate code (declaring those two member variables in both derived classes) rather than declare in the base class?</p>


<p>Is it not best practice to declare these variables in the Player class? </p>


<p></p>


<p>Thank you! </p>

-------------------------------------------------
<div class="markdown" id="q38kRj58oo1ooY"><p>I’m not sure why they aren’t defined in the header file - maybe the project wants to make us think outside the box more and create our own variables - but yes I think that would be best practice.</p></div>

trump is a valid suit

<p>followup on this, did you run make Card_public_test.exe to create the executable?</p>

<p>yes to both. My file looks the same as it does above and I created the executable, still doesn't work</p>

-------------------------------------------------
<p>Curious, what was the issue?</p>

Empty() at what point
<p>When is the pack considered to be empty? Because the bottom card has an index of 23 but we would want to "draw" that card so would next increment again and be 24 before there are no cards left? Is that the maximum value that next could reach? or should we account for when next is &gt;= to 24?</p>

-------------------------------------------------
<div class="markdown" id="q38kRj58oo0ooY"><p>I think you may have answered your own question here - the question you want to answer is “what is the value of <code>next</code> <strong>after</strong> we have drawn our last card?”, because if next is at that value, then you know you’ve gone through the whole deck (making it empty).</p></div>

-------------------------------------------------

------------------------@1665-------------------------
Hardcoding shuffle
<p>Are we allowed to hardcode shuffle? By this I mean can we write out the order of the original indicies 0 - 23 after 7 in-shuffles (0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 ----&gt; 12 0 13 1 14 2 15 3 16 4 17 5 18 6 19 7 20 8 21 9 22 10 23 11 but done 6 more times instead of just once) and then use these indicies to recorder the cards in the pack? or is there amore eloquent way to do it than hardcoding? Like should we reorder indicies with their own loops before reordering pack instead of just using the order of indicies we know would occur after seven shuffles from writing it out on paper?</p>


<p></p>


<p>If there is an even more eloquent way than this, is there another resource we could reference other than the wikipedia page? I found the explanation there a bit confusing. Or any hints/first steps?</p>


<p></p>


<p></p>

-------------------------------------------------
<div class="markdown" id="q38kRj58oo0ooY"><p>Yes, you could theoretically hard code this, but as per usual in hardcoding, it goes against the functionality of the function. What if you want to shuffle 52 cards instead of 26? What if that’s a private test case?</p>
<p>In this class we don’t really need to care too much about efficiency, so the naive solution of writing an inshuffle to move around the indices once and then looping it 7 times should be sufficient. If you are having trouble finding this pattern, starting to hardcode it actually might help you find it.</p></div>

Left bower or Right bower
<p>Is the left or right bower the trump suit? I've read multiple posts saying the left is the trump suit but on the spec it says the right bower is the trump suit. What does this mean?</p>

-------------------------------------------------
<p><img alt="image.png" src="/redirect/s3?bucket=uploads&amp;prefix=paste%2Fky1p65245ra4by%2F389698c27bc2b12a5b96804aa26b333715b37ece908bcc8357593b46167c4ba7%2Fimage.png"/></p>


<p></p>


<p>So, if the trump suit is Spades, then all cards that have the Spades suit is a trump card, including the Right Bower, i.e. the most powerful card in that round, the Jack of Spades. The Left Bower in this case would be the Jack of Clubs, and it is the second most powerful card in that round. The Left Bower, the Jack of Clubs, is a trump card as well.</p>

<p></p>


<p>Hello! I just wanted to clarify that the bool operator function overload is just comparing two ranks instead of actual value of the card. For example, a Jack has a lower value then an Ace, thus Jack &lt; Ace is true. Is this the correct idea?</p>

-------------------------------------------------
<div class="markdown" id="q38kRj58oo0ooY"><p>When not considering trump or lead, you should compare based on rank <strong>as well as</strong> the suit ordering defined in <code>SUIT_NAMES_BY_WEIGHT</code> in <code>Card.h</code>. See <a href="https://eecs280staff.github.io/p3-euchre/#value-of-cards" target="_blank">https://eecs280staff.github.io/p3-euchre/#value-of-cards</a> for more.</p></div>

Question about interface
<p>Hi, I am not sure about the term 'interface'. Is it the functions for a class? Also, why we need interface to access data instead of directly accessing it? Are we afraid of people changing the original data? Thank you so much!</p>

-------------------------------------------------
Using the interface (class functions you are creating) allows you to change the implementation of the interface functions later without breaking code that use them. 
<a href="https://eecs280staff.github.io/notes/11_Container_ADTs.html#container-adts" rel="noreferrer" target="_blank">https://eecs280staff.github.io/notes/11_Container_ADTs.html#container-adts</a>
 has more information!

-------------------------------------------------
<p>The interface contains the declarations of a class's member functions and member variables - I like to think of it as how a class looks from the outside, including all of the ways you can interact with it.</p>


<p></p>


<p>For example, in project 2, the interface of a Matrix was a 2D object that had rows and columns. Yet the implementation of it from our perspective as the developer is a 1D data array storing the values.</p>


<p></p>


<p>You typically see interfaces defined in the .h files of projects in this class, then you provide the implementations in .cpp files.</p>

-------------------------------------------------

------------------------@1670-------------------------
using namespace std; and function stubs
<p>Would including <kbd>using namespace std; </kbd>in our Card.cpp file and removing <kbd>std::</kbd> from function stubs require us to do the same for the function stubs in Card.h, or will the compiler be able to recognize that the functions are still the same? (just one is implicitly calling <kbd>std::</kbd>)</p>

-------------------------------------------------
Yes, you wouldn’t have to modify Card.h.

-------------------------------------------------
<p>Is including <kbd>using namespace std;</kbd> generally okay in header files as well?</p>

-------------------------------------------------
The good practice is not to do that.

-------------------------------------------------
<div class="markdown" id="q38kRj58oo0ooY"><p>Do not put a namespace in a header file because it can cause issues in future <code>.cpp</code> files that include that header file.</p></div>

== operator clarification
<p>Should the operator return true if both cards are of the same rank? or only if they are of the same rank and suit. IE would a jack of hearts and a jack of clubs return equal, or would it have to be a jack of hearts and a jack of hearts.</p>


<p></p>

-------------------------------------------------
The operator should return true if both cards are of the same rank and same suit. (it would have to be a jack of hearts and a jack of hearts to return equal)

-------------------------------------------------
<p>can I do lhs.get_rank() == rhs.get_rank() for this? or is the == operator in c++ unable to do string comparison?</p>

-------------------------------------------------
<p>That is perfectly fine!</p>

-------------------------------------------------
<p>You are most likely indexing out of bounds in an array past the end. As the student answer suggests, running the test with the address sanitizer may help you find where this is occurring in your function. You may also be able to find it using the debugger.</p>

led suit
If the trump suit is diamond and the led card is jack of heart, what will the led suit be? Will it still be heart or change to diamond?

-------------------------------------------------
<p>It will be diamond. If the trump suit is diamond, the Jack of Hearts (left bower) becomes a diamond. Thus, when it leads, it makes the led suit a diamond.</p>

false positive testing
<p>My tests are showing up as false positives but everything seems to be running. I am using a similar/same template to the ones given in cards_public_tests. </p>

-------------------------------------------------
A false positive means when tested against a correct implementation the test failed and caught a bug when there wasn’t one. In other words, one or more of your assert statements evaluated to false when they should’ve evaluated to true.

-------------------------------------------------

------------------------@1675-------------------------
For overloaded operators, should it consider suit if it considers rank?
<p>For the overloaded operator less than, if I am comparing if the nine of diamonds is less than the jack of hearts, does it return true or false? I'm wondering because Diamonds is a higher suit but jack is a higher rank.</p>

-------------------------------------------------
<p>Rank overrides suit. So, if you are comparing the nine of diamonds and the jack of hearts the nine of diamonds would be less. The overall logic is compare rank then, if the same, compare suit.</p>

Segmentation Fault

<p>I would recommend using the visual debugger as well as ASAN (<a href="https://eecs280staff.github.io/p1-stats/setup_asan.html" rel="noreferrer" target="_blank">https://eecs280staff.github.io/p1-stats/setup_asan.html</a>) to find where the error is coming from.</p>

deal_one()
<p>For the deal_one() function, are you just returning the next card in the pack, or are you also removing that card from the pack? </p>

-------------------------------------------------
<p>You wouldn't necessarily remove the card from the pack though by incrementing the next index you effectively are. Once the next index reaches the end of the pack then the pack is "empty".</p>


<p></p>


<p>Notably the pack contains an array of cards - you cannot change the size of an array once it is created.</p>

-------------------------------------------------
<p>The RME statements in the header file may also help:</p>


<p></p>


<p><img alt="image.png" src="/redirect/s3?bucket=uploads&amp;prefix=paste%2Fk033o7oug8s2w7%2Fd881117613d8f37cf3564e14ede8d0dcca9ebbda8a79d86729dcef88b337a7ed%2Fimage.png"/></p>

-------------------------------------------------

------------------------@1678-------------------------
For overloaded operator less than or equal to, should it consider suit?
<p>I know that for the overator less than you should compare the suit if the rank of both cards are equal, but for less than or equal to it returns true if the ranks are equal. Do I only consider rank for the less than or equal operator?</p>

-------------------------------------------------
You should still consider the suit. A hint for the operators is many can be used as inverses or combinations of others, E.g. less than or equal to can be broken down into less than || equal to (or !(greater than))

-------------------------------------------------
<p>less than or equal should return true if card a is less than card b OR if they are the same card (meaning the rank and suit are the same) so you probably wanna check if the ranks are equal as well as the suit</p>

-------------------------------------------------

------------------------@1679-------------------------
Hint: Left Bower is the trump suit
<p>For get_suit(trump) what suit are we returning? And why is the hint saying that the left bower is the trump suit when in the rules of the game it says that the right bower is the trump suit?</p>

-------------------------------------------------
<p>The jack of the trump suit is the right bower. The jack of the next suit (same color suit) is the left bower. For this card, its suit should be considered the same as the trump suit. For example, if the trump suit is hearts the left bower would be the jack of diamonds and its suit would be considered hearts, not diamonds.</p>

-------------------------------------------------
<p>It's difficult to tell what is wrong, but I think you may want to check 1. your pack constructor (Did you initialize all member variables?) 2. your deal_one() (you may want to step into the function rather than try to step over it)</p>

what is the next suit?

Test
<p>My code keeps passing and failing one assert, it just goes back and forth without me touching the code. I make clean then make card public test the do the ./ command two times, once itll say an assert failed and once not. What does this mean?</p>

-------------------------------------------------
<div class="markdown" id="q38kRj58oo0ooY"><p>This is indicative of undefined behavior. I am not entirely sure of the exact issue without more context, but I would double check that for whatever assert is failing, you have initialized all variables being used. Sometimes this kind of issue pops up when you forget to initialize a variable - for some runs that variable is initialized with a value that aligns with the assert passing, for other runs it might just get some garbage value. The easiest way to debug this would be with your visual debugger - you could see whatever variable has a garbage value when the assert is hit.</p></div>

Constructors
<p>I'm super confused about the derived classes. How is this reducing redundant code when we're still coding the same function twice? Also, I'm confused as to what to put as the parameter for the Player constructors because we have to come up with our own variables correct? If anyone could give me some guidance that'd be awesome!</p>

-------------------------------------------------
<div class="markdown" id="q38kRj58oo0ooY"><p>Derived classes allow abstraction so that the code that uses the <code>Player</code> class doesn’t have to be changed for two different types of players. If you were to do without derived classes, you’d still have to write all the functions twice for different kinds of players and behaviors - having them in classes allows there to be more logical structure.</p>
<p>The only thing you should initialize in your constructors is the name. Everything else gets filled or used through the other functions.</p></div>

-------------------------------------------------
<p>So, to clarify, we have to write our own non-default constructors for each simple player and human player that initializes the name? Do they each need default constructors as well?</p>

-------------------------------------------------
<div class="markdown" id="q38kRj58oo1ooY"><p>Default constructors doesn’t hurt, but yeah you should also have a non-default constructor to initialize the name.</p></div>

Question about PACK_SIZE.
<div class="markdown" id="q38kRj58oo1ooY"><p>Just out of curious, I am wondering if the PACK_SIZE would be a number other than 24.</p></div>

Not for the purpose of this project as far as I am aware. It’s more to show that the interface could be implemented for other games (e.g. games that use the standard 52 card deck).

<div class="markdown" id="q38kRj58oo0ooY"><p>As per the student response, the pack size will always be 24 for this project. Having a variable for this is good practice since it means you don’t have to hard code the pack size elsewhere throughout your code.</p></div>

add_card
<p>For the add card function, I created a private variable of an array of 5 for the cards in the players hands. If the array is empty, how do we access the last element of the array that doesn't have an element, even if it's not size-1? Is that allowed?</p>

-------------------------------------------------
<div class="markdown" id="q38kRj58oo0ooY"><p>Consider using a vector instead of an array, it’s easier to add and remove elements.</p>
<p>If you do decide to keep using an array, you can still access the last element of the array, as long as you initialized the array itself. Just don’t try to assume anything about the last element, it’s likely write only if you hadn’t put anything there.</p></div>

left bower question
<p>is the left bower the same ranking as a card of the same suit as the right bower that ISNT the jack or is it above it?</p>

-------------------------------------------------
Is the second highest card so yes, it would be above all the other cards in the trump suit except the right bower (the Jack of trump suit).

Pack Implementation
<p>Should we implement pack not assuming that the number of cards is 24? Like should our implementation work for a pack of 52 cards or a pack of, say, 37 cards (or an uneven number --- thinking about this in terms of shuffle)?</p>


<p></p>


<p>Or may we assume that the number of cards is 24?</p>

-------------------------------------------------
<div class="markdown" id="q38kRj58oo0ooY"><p>It’s best to implement agnostic of pack size.</p></div>

-------------------------------------------------
<div class="markdown" id="q38kRj58oo2ooY"><p>In <code>Pack.h</code>, you can see that there is a private pack size variable declared:<br/>
<code>static const int PACK_SIZE = 24;</code><br/>
This variable is constant for any pack you create, so it will not change. You can assume this is the set pack size as you implement the pack functions (ie. shuffle).</p></div>

-------------------------------------------------
<p>If we are implementing for any pack size, then we could theoretically have an odd number of cards. How should we account for this in an in-shuffle? Since for an in-shuffle the pack is split in half and you cannot split an odd number of cards in half?</p>

-------------------------------------------------
<div class="markdown" id="q38kRj58oo1ooY"><p>From <a href="http://jwilson.coe.uga.edu/EMT668/EMAT6680.2000/Simmons/Essay4/Essay4.html" rel="noreferrer" target="_blank">magic</a>, it should be that an in shuffle with an odd number of cards has the top half slightly smaller than the bottom half and the top card still the second card, but it’s not actually in the Wikipedia article anywhere so maybe you don’t have to account for odd size decks, my bad.</p>
<p>Best to have an instructor answer this. Also, if you are interested in any kind of magic, consider joining Michigan Magic! We need more members 😃.</p></div>

-------------------------------------------------
<p>My Pack() function is initializing 52 cards and storing in cards array. Should I only be iinitializing cards rank 9 and up since array has a size of only 24?</p>

-------------------------------------------------
<div class="markdown" id="q38kRj58oo3ooY"><p>Yes pack should only have those 24 cards.</p></div>

card non default constructor syntax errors
<p>Hi, I'm having trouble getting the right syntax with the const std::string parameters -- I understand we need to set the rank and suit but keep getting errors with my syntax. Should we use Card:: like the default constructor, or is there another way to do this</p>

-------------------------------------------------
<div class="markdown" id="q38kRj58oo0ooY"><p>Yep, this constructor is technically a function of the <code>Card</code> class, so you should also put <code>Card::</code> in front of it.</p></div>

-------------------------------------------------
<p>I did do this for the actual constructor but am confused on how to use the parameters to set the ranks and suits</p>

-------------------------------------------------
<p>Without explicitly writing the code you should be able to just set the rank variable to the rank_in variable (and the suit variable to the suit_in variable). The rank variable itself does not need Card:: in front of it.<br/><br/>For instance, if in my class <kbd>Crayon</kbd> I have a variable <kbd>color </kbd>my constructor might look like the following:</p>


<pre>Crayon::Crayon(<span class="hljs-keyword">const</span> <span class="hljs-built_in">std</span>::<span class="hljs-built_in">string</span>&amp; color_in) {
  color = color_in;

Error with libraries on opening files
<p>When I open my code, all of my libraries are immediately underlined with the error message "cannot open source file "_____"" for whatever library it is referencing.  When I tried to open a WSL window to fix this, I received multiple errors and could not open it.  Is there a way to fix this?</p>

-------------------------------------------------
<div class="markdown" id="q38kRj58oo0ooY"><p>The followups below are good - also check that you don’t mistakenly write e.g. <code>&lt;vector.h&gt;</code> instead of <code>&lt;vector&gt;</code>. C++ library stuff should not have the .h suffix, only your own files.</p>

tests
<p>Are we writing tests for operator functions? or just the card ones?</p>

-------------------------------------------------
<p>I'd recommend writing tests for both as they will both be used later.</p>

-------------------------------------------------
<p>Yes, testing the operators would be a good idea. To test an operator, you would just need to use that operator on two card objects. For example, Card a &lt; Card b.</p>

Shuffle helper function
<p>I probably overcomplicated this function, but this was the way that made sense to me logically, however I fear that it doesn't work... That said, I just don't understand why I can't create these arrays to feed into the function so that I can at least debug it<a href="/redirect/s3?bucket=uploads&amp;prefix=paste%2Fksyvy6hp7go3ig%2F91d1de953ecea141d096921b7581573697237a837e938d69b61aa61620e21f4d%2FScreenshot_2022-10-04_at_22.50.55.png" rel="noreferrer" target="_blank">Screenshot_2022-10-04_at_22.50.55.png</a>? </p>


<p></p>


<p>I hope this question is okay to ask... If not, so sorry!</p>

-------------------------------------------------
<div class="markdown" id="q38kRj58oo0ooY"><p>So the first error is in the initialization of <code>topHalf</code> and <code>bottomHalf</code>. Its just a simple syntax error where you can’t use the <code>cards.begin()</code> iterator to initialize the card. What you should instead is a more direct card by card initialization using a loop.</p>
<p>The second error is a result of you passing in an <code>std:array</code> object into the recShuffle function. Recall that C arrays are different than C++ arrays. The function <code>recShuffle</code> takes in two pointers to ints as an argument, but you pass in an stl object. Therefore, the compiler will complain and tell you that you’re passing in the wrong things. Another error with that line is that <code>recShuffle</code> doesn’t return a result, yet you use it to reassign it to cards. You can only use the <code>=</code> operator for assigning one object to another, so make sure you are returning an object at the end of recShuffle so you can assign it to cards.</p></div>

shuffle() correct result?
<p>So I tried doing in-shuffle 7 times, and I believe that after the shuffles the first card should be a king of spades instead of king of clubs as written in the public test case. I asked my friend and he got the same answer. I don't think there's a problem with my code (I'd love to share it but I think I'm not allowed to post my code here?) Can anyone explain it?

-------------------------------------------------
<div class="markdown" id="q38kRj58oo1ooY"><p>The public test case isn’t wrong. Keep in mind that <code>shuffle</code> should shuffle the deck 7 times, and check that your <code>Pack</code> initial order is correct.</p></div>

Weights in overloaded operators.
<p>Not sure how to use RANK_NAMES_BY_WEIGHT and SUIT_NAMES_BY_WEIGHT arrays to code the overloaded operators. I am thinking of seeing what indexes each card's rank/suit is at to compare, but unsure how to find the index of the arrays. </p>

-------------------------------------------------
<div class="markdown" id="q38kRj58oo0ooY"><p>You can use the == operator to compare your card’s suit/rank to every element in RANK_NAMES / SUIT_NAMES. Remember we have the size of these arrays defined as constants in card.h (NUM_SUITS and NUM_RANKS).
Also, make sure to read the operator tutorial. You only need to code 2 operators. The rest can be derived from just those two.</p></div>

Player Factory

-------------------------------------------------
<div class="markdown" id="q38kRj58oo0ooY"><p>Have you implemented the <code>SimplePlayer</code> class, or at least defined it in the file? Make sure you are returning a pointer and not an object in the Player factory function as well.</p></div>

-------------------------------------------------
<p>SimplePlayer is a class which you should create based on the Player class. It is not in the starter code.</p>

-------------------------------------------------
<p>Yes I did and when I make it a pointer it say it's expecting a type but I thought "SimplePlayer" is a type</p>

-------------------------------------------------
<p>Make sure you define SimplePlayer earlier in your code than when you define the player factory function. Order matters in this case.</p>

-------------------------------------------------
<p>You might want to try adding function stubs for all of the pure virtual functions inherited from the base Player class in SimplePlayer if you haven't already. I believe without the stubs the compiler won't recognize SimplePlayer as a valid class.</p>

-------------------------------------------------
<p>I have function stubs and some of the functions are implemented for SimplePlayer and HumanPlayer before the factory function so it's been defined before accessing it.</p>

How to check cards in Player's hand after function call?
<p>If we're testing the Player functions and want to check the player's hand or hand.size() after a function call, what would be the best way to do it? Since print_hand() is a private function, I'm confused on how we can assert different expectations for what should be in the player's hand after a Player function is called.</p>

-------------------------------------------------
<p>I don't believe there's a way to directly check the player's hand after a function call since the corresponding functions and variables are all private. What you can do is after calling a function that edits hand, like <kbd>add_and_discard()</kbd>, you can then call functions such as <kbd>lead_card()</kbd> repeatedly to check if the rest of the cards are what you expect.</p>

EXC_BAD_ACCESS
<p>Hi, </p>


<p>I am currently experiencing an issue where my public Pack tests are leading to a "EXC_BAD_ACCESS" error in Xcode. This is occurring in the card.h file. I have attached a screenshot. Is there any reason for this happening?</p>


<p>. <img alt="Screen_Shot_2022-10-05_at_2.44.43_PM.pngNaN" height="282" src="/redirect/s3?bucket=uploads&amp;prefix=paste%2Fky0sfdd2vr188%2Fb0fa27b4f47c32b2bede408749bd45ab8aa5b215596db051468ab7b125c32de2%2FScreen_Shot_2022-10-05_at_2.44.43_PM.png" width="507"/></p>

-------------------------------------------------
<p>Resolved</p>

-------------------------------------------------
<p>This could be the result of undefined behavior - what does running ASAN (<a href="https://eecs280staff.github.io/p1-stats/setup_asan.html" rel="noreferrer" target="_blank">https://eecs280staff.github.io/p1-stats/setup_asan.html</a>) tell you?</p>

-------------------------------------------------
I had the same result because of undefined behavior, Make sure you're checking your arguments so they don't continue on forever. For example, in mine I had an argument checking if two suits were equal but I forgot to include trump so it just went on forever.

confused about ranking
<p>what is the ranking between, regular trump, the led card, the left bower card and the right bower card?</p>

-------------------------------------------------
<p><a href="https://eecs280staff.github.io/p3-euchre/#value-of-cards" rel="noreferrer" target="_blank">https://eecs280staff.github.io/p3-euchre/#value-of-cards</a></p>


<p>This link explains the value of the cards pretty well. Essentially, right bower &gt; left bower &gt; trump suit cards &gt; led suit cards &gt; all non-trump-suit non-led-suit cards. Additionally, keep in mind that the suits have a defined order as well, which are considered if the ranks are the same, and neither trump or led suit applies.</p>

Pack Constructor
<p>I am confused as to what the pack constructor is actually supposed to do. I understand that one implementation of Pack needs to be done without input and the other is done by reading a file, but what I don't understand is how the actual card information is supposed to be stored. My guess is that Pack is an array, but I couldn't find anywhere that said that explicitly. Is pack supposed to generate an array?</p>

-------------------------------------------------
<div class="markdown" id="q38kRj58oo0ooY"><p>In the <code>Pack.h</code> file, one of the private variables for the <code>Pack</code> class is the <code>cards</code> array. You are to put the cards in the pack in this array.</p></div>

-------------------------------------------------
<p>Pack is a class, and it does have an array as its private member variable <code>std::array&lt;Card, PACK_SIZE&gt; cards</code>. So. you do not want to "generate" an array, but think about how you want to initialize it (and maybe other member variables) in the constructors.</p>

-------------------------------------------------

------------------------@1711-------------------------
Picking trump
<p>The first time around the table what are we supposed to do if a human player tries to input a suit that does not match the upcard?</p>

-------------------------------------------------
<p>I think when it says that we can assume that the human player's input will be accurate, it also means that the human player's input will follow the rules of the game. So, I don't think we need to account for this specific case. I also believe similar logic should apply if the human player can follow the led suit, but chooses to not anyways.</p>

Using add_and_discard within make_trump
<p>After the Player makes trump, the specification says they should add that card and discard the lower one, which obviously would be done with add_and_discard.</p>


<p>However, that function is not const, while make_trump is, so I can't run one within the other.</p>


<p></p>


<p>Using</p>


<pre>this-&gt;add_and_discard(upcard); </pre>
<p>is not allowed since add_and_discard is not a const function.</p>


<p></p>


<p>What's the workaround to be able to call this function here? I'm staying away from casting anything as const for obvious reasons, but I can't figure out how you'd call the function within this method.</p>

-------------------------------------------------
<p>You do not actually include the <kbd>add_and_discard()</kbd> function in the <kbd>make_trump()</kbd> function. That will likely be done in the <kbd>euchre.cpp</kbd> file, which coordinates the game.</p>

Initializing the two of spades

<p>We were having trouble initializing the two of spades and we keep failing the public test. Was there something that we were missing?</p>

-------------------------------------------------
<p>So what you’re doing here is calling the constructor in the code of your constructor, essentially doing a recursive construction call which is illegal. If you intend to use an initializer list - which you should be doing - touch up on the syntax of an initializer list <a href="https://eecs280staff.github.io/notes/08_ADTs_in_C++.html?highlight=constructor#constructors" rel="noreferrer" target="_blank">here</a>.</p>

Unknown type error running Player_tests

<pre>Player.cpp:13:16: error: unknown type name 'SimplePlayer'

<p>I have SimplePlayer defined in Player.cpp in the same way we did it in lecture. Any idea what might be causing this? The starting code (where this error is taking place) is copy-pasted from the specification, so I know that's not the issue.</p>

-------------------------------------------------
<div class="markdown" id="q38kRj58oo0ooY"><p>Have you created the SimplePlayer class yet? You’ll have to create your own SimplePlayer class that extends the Player class in Player.cpp.</p></div>

Player factory not able to access HumanPlayer
<div class="markdown" id="q38kRj58oo0ooY"><p>Hello, I am getting an error in my player file when checking for HumanPlayer in player factory. Although I have a constructor in my HumanPlayer class that takes in a string, when I try to call it in factory file, I get an error. It reads:“HumanPlayer::HumanPlayer(const std::__1::string &amp;name_in)” (declared at line 189) is inaccessibleC/C++(330)". The constructor is in the public section of that class and the same idea is working for SimplePlayer. Does anyone know what might be causing this error?</p></div>

-------------------------------------------------
<p>Not exactly sure, but a lot of problems with player factory have to do with not having all of the functions implemented in both the human class and the simple class. Try to implement the functions for both classes first, then post a followup if this doesn't get resolved</p>

custom function not declared in scope
<p>I made a custom function to help me simplify a task but got an error in the Autograder saying that "it was not declared in this scope." I included the declaration in the header file and followed code syntax. What might be causing this issue?</p>

-------------------------------------------------
Scroll down to the restrictions sections on the project spec. You should declare the function as static and not include it in the header file (the header file should always remain the same as the starter code).

-------------------------------------------------
<p>I'm not sure why you would declare the function as static. There aren't any static variables in the project...</p>

Should we use member-initializer lists
<p>Hello, I believe in lecture and lecture notes we were told that using member-initializer lists are good practice when creating constructors. However, I am not sure if it is required/recommended for this project. I also don't see it in the header files. Should I add them?</p>


<p>Thanks.</p>

-------------------------------------------------
<p>You should be using member-initialization lists. The reason why they don’t exist in the header files is because the actual code for the constructors should be written in the .cpp files. </p>

Can you use overloaded operators in the definition of other overloaded operators?

Yes, in fact that’s encouraged! Just make sure you don’t end up in a loop.

Player Factory

I still can't figure out why I'm getting errors still as I have the functions implemented in both SimplePlayer and HumanPlayer so I was just wondering if there was a way to test my functions without having to use the Factory function. Thanks</p>

-------------------------------------------------
<p>You probably could test your functions for the time being by just creating a SimplePlayer object without dynamic allocation, as the constructor is still public. However, it’s probably best to just figure out why factory doesn’t work, and use the factory in the tests.</p>

do I need to use a temporary array for shuffle?
<p>Is a temporary array necessary to shuffle the deck of cards? I tried writing a function using the original array and temporary card objects, but I am finding that I need a lot of temporary cards. </p>

-------------------------------------------------
Pointers may come in handy here. Or, using an array of the original array’s indices.

-------------------------------------------------
<div class="markdown" id="q38kRj58oo0ooY"><p>If using a temporary array makes the most sense to you, that is a perfectly fine way to go about shuffle. My opinion is that this is also the approach that is least likely to lead to logic mistakes.</p></div>

-------------------------------------------------
<p>I’m not 100% sure how I would accomplish this using pointers, would someone be able to provide an example or a hint that I could work off of?</p>

-------------------------------------------------
<p>Can I just use for loops? and change the array order 7 times?</p>

-------------------------------------------------
Sounds like a solid plan to me!

-------------------------------------------------
<p>Is using a vector to store the first deck of cards in a queue a valid option? I found it easier to deal with that way</p>

-------------------------------------------------
<p>Yes, and you’ll see that this helps later on because you can make use of the sort function which is integrated in the vector library. I originally was using arrays but switched over to vectors and it made things a lot simpler! You can use arrays if that makes more sense to you tho</p>

The comparing operator<
<p>According to the requirements,</p>


<div>

<div>But we need to think of the suit color even if two values are equal. Am I overthinking for this function? Should I consider that situation?</div>
</div>

-------------------------------------------------
If the ranks are equal then you consider suit color. Else, rank decides which is higher.

-------------------------------------------------
<p>But what is the purpose of writing &lt;= operator for the next function? Each poker card is unique and they cannot be equal. Thx!</p>

-------------------------------------------------
Possibly to show the ability of the class to be adapted to other games? Also keep in mind you only really have to implement two of the operator overrides and the rest can be combinations or negations of each other.

<div class="markdown" id="q38kRj58oo0ooY"><p>You are correct that in the context of euchre, we won’t have duplicates of a card. This is more-so for completeness of the <code>Card</code> class.</p></div>

-------------------------------------------------
<div class="markdown" id="q38kRj58oo0ooY"><p>I assume you are thinking in terms of the <code>get_suit()</code> function here. Technically speaking, the compiler is not going to prevent you from changing the suit of a card anywhere in the <code>Card</code> class. However, I would caution against this. If you changes the rank/suit of a card in the game, you no longer have that card for use. For example, if you were to change the <code>Jack of Hearts</code> to be <code>Diamonds</code> when it is the left bower, you’d be left with a pack that has two <code>Jack of Diamonds</code> and no <code>Jack of Hearts</code>. I would instead just return the trump suit if you realize you are looking at the left bower.</p></div>

<p>This is what I wrote in Card()</p>

<p>My other constructor works fine and passes its test</p>


<p>I get the same error if I just use the regular constructor in the default one</p>


<p></p>


<p>I just don't understand how writing a default constructor works when we write the implementation separate from the header.</p>

-------------------------------------------------
<p>When you want to call the default constructor (and initialize an instance of your Card class), you do not need to put the () after your object name, in this case c.</p>


<p></p>


<p>Try replacing your declaration with:</p>


<p><kbd>Card c;</kbd></p>


<p></p>


<p>Right now, I think your compiler is reading this as if you were trying to declare a new function called <kbd>c</kbd> which returns a Card and takes no parameters, but by getting rid of the parenthesis you will actually create a Card instance called c by implicitly calling the default constructor.</p>

Identical Issue as @1694
<p>Hello, I am receiving the same error as the student in question <a data-pats="post_ref" href="1694" onclick="return PE.gotoPost('1694');">@1694</a>. I have verified that my pack ctor initializes the cards in the correct order, and as the code shows below, the in-shuffle is completed 7 times. I was wondering if you could take a look and help me understand where I might be going wrong. Thank you.</p>


<p></p>


<p><code>    void Pack::shuffle(){<br/>  next = 0;<br/>  std::array&lt;Card, PACK_SIZE / 2&gt; firstHalf;<br/>  std::array&lt;Card, PACK_SIZE / 2&gt; secondHalf;<br/>  std::array&lt;Card, PACK_SIZE&gt; inShuffled;<br/><br/>  //Outer for loop ensures the in shuffle is done 7 times.<br/>  for(int doSeven = 0; doSeven &lt; 7; doSeven++){<br/><br/>    //split into half decks<br/>    for(int i = 0; i &lt; PACK_SIZE / 2; i++){<br/>      firstHalf[i] = cards[i];<br/>      secondHalf[i] = cards[i + 12];<br/>    }<br/><br/>    //copy them into an aux array, in correct order.<br/>    for(int i = 0; i &lt; PACK_SIZE; i++){<br/><br/>      //If index of aux is even, take from second half.<br/>      if(i % 2 == 0){<br/>        inShuffled[i] = secondHalf[i / 2];<br/>      }<br/>      <br/>      //If index of aux is odd, take from first half.<br/>      else{<br/>        inShuffled[i] = firstHalf[i / 2];<br/>      }<br/>    }<br/><br/>    //Copys from inShuffled into cards.<br/>    std::copy(begin(inShuffled), end(inShuffled), begin(cards));<br/>  }<br/>}<br/></code></p>

-------------------------------------------------
<div class="markdown" id="q38kRj58oo0ooY"><p>From your autograder submission, I think the issue may be coming from your <code>Pack</code> constructor rather than the shuffle function. Per the RME for the default <code>Pack</code> constructor:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>Initializes the Pack to be in the following standard order: <br/> the cards of the lowest suit arranged from lowest rank to highest rank, followed by the cards of the next lowest suit in order from lowest to highest rank, and so on.</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>It seems like your Pack is initialized with all of the nines followed by all of the tens, etc. Instead, you want all of the Spades followed by all of the Hearts, etc.</p></div>

Autograder has issues with my helper functions
<p>In my card.cpp I declared some static non-member helper functions and I didn't modify card.h, and I called the helper functions in my card functions. It compiles on my end, and they do their job but in the autograder there is an error for each time I call the helpers saying "[my helper function] was not declared in this scope". Also, there are errors for each helper saying "'[my helper function]' defined but not used [-Werror=unused-function]". I thought I followed the protocol properly, if anyone can tell me what is wrong with the helper functions I would really appreciate it. Thank you. </p>

-------------------------------------------------
<p>You need to declare those helper functions before your class. I noticed that in you cpp files, those functions are declare after class Card.</p>

Human Player cheating
<p>Just double checking, we don't need to add assert statements or something in the Human Player to make sure the input wasn't incorrect or invalid right? Also, is there a way we can test the human player or do we have to wait to implement euchre.cpp</p>

-------------------------------------------------
<p>As for checking if the input is valid/not cheating, check FAQ.  They address the question there saying that you can assume the player is not cheating.  </p>


<p></p>


<p>When it comes to testing human player I'm not entirely sure but I'd assume you wouldn't get points off if you did test it.  You would just have to run manual tests similar to testing SimplePlayer (take this with a grain of salt).  </p>

should order up be a private member variable
<p>In the make_trump function RME it says "</p>


<div>
<div>If Player wishes to order up a trump suit then return true and</div>
<div>// change order_up_suit to desired suit."</div>
</div>

-------------------------------------------------
<p>The order_up_suit is passed into the function by reference, so you can go ahead and change that variable. No need to create a private member variable.</p>

player tests
<p>are play, lead, and make trump the only functions that can have edge cases for player_cpp_tests. Also, are we supposed to test anything for human player or just simple player. </p>


<p></p>


<p>Thanks. </p>

-------------------------------------------------
<div class="markdown" id="q38kRj58oo0ooY"><p>I would say all the functions besides <code>get_name</code> probably have edge cases of some sort. For the checkpoint, we’re just running public test cases, and player’s public test case tests behavior for simple players only (except that you should be able to create a human player via <code>Player_factory</code>). If you’re asking about writing test cases to catch bugs on the autograder, those are for simple player only.</p></div>

How to set the rank and suit of a card in a pack?
<p>I understand how to create the pack constructor except for how I am supposed to set the rank and suit of each card in the pack. It seems like the only function that allows you to do that that's available for a Card is the constructor, but the Cards already exist if they are in the array already, right? It also doesn't seem to be allowing me to use the constructor for this purpose. Are we supposed to create our own functions to set rank and suit or am I missing something?</p>

-------------------------------------------------
<p>You're right that you need to use the Card constructor to make cards, since it explicitly sets the rank and suit. You need to make Cards then put them in the "cards" array. Hint: Use a loop to make it more efficient!</p>

-------------------------------------------------
<p>I guess what I'm confused about there is that I can't create cards within a loop, because it would try to remake the same card over and over again, right? Is there another way to do this?</p>

-------------------------------------------------
<p>You can call the Card constructor whenever you want to create a new card. For example:</p>


<p></p>


<p>Card c1(Card::RANK_JACK, Card::SUIT_HEARTS);</p>


<p>c1 = Card(Card::RANK_NINE, Card::SUIT_CLUBS);</p>


<p></p>


<p>This would set c1 to a Jack of Hearts, then the next line sets it to a Nine of Clubs.</p>

-------------------------------------------------
<p>Ohh, thank you so much! I completely missed that you could do that with constructors.</p>

Trouble getting full points on Player_tests
<p>Hi,</p>


<p></p>


<p>I've written what I think is a pretty comprehensive set of test cases for the Simple Player. However, my Player_tests() is only catching 13/17+ bugs.</p>


<p></p>


<p>1. Our tests should only test simple player, correct? or should we include test functions for some of the basic functions of human player also?</p>


<p>2. I don't know if I'm going about this wrong? For all the other classes in P2 and P3 so far, my first round of writing test cases was sufficient to catch enough bugs. Any tips on how to go about this?</p>


<p></p>


<p>Thank you,</p>


<p>Muskaan </p>

-------------------------------------------------
<p>Based on an instructor response on a similar question, the autograder is only checking for SimplePlayer tests, not Human.  As for tests, a piece of advice given during the SI lecture was to go through and play games (against either friends or online) and use that as a basis for your tests.  Otherwise just keep searching for edge cases.  One place I found helpful to reference when checking for those is the card hierarchy diagram in the spec.  Hope that helps!  </p>


<p></p>


<p>Also double check by clicking on your tests in the autograder that you don't have any false positives.  </p>

Some questions to prepare for midterm
<p>Hi.</p>


<p></p>


<p>Sorry for the questions:</p>


<p></p>


<p>1. Will running tests of functions on compilers be allowed during tests?</p>


<p></p>


<p>2. When will be the earliest date that we receive a practice exam with solutions? If I want to start early, are past tests offered or are they good practices?</p>


<p></p>


<p>3. Is there any recommended resources?</p>


<p></p>

-------------------------------------------------
<p><a data-pats="post_ref" href="2087" onclick="return PE.gotoPost('2087');">@2087</a></p>

<p>I definitely recommend the practice tests that were recently released (can be found on the eecs280 website in files section on left hand side of toolbar ). I also recommend reading the prepared lecture notes which can be found on the left hand tool bar as well.</p>

Card_less
<p>//REQUIRES trump is a valid suit</p>


<p>//EFFECTS Returns true if a is lower value than b.  Uses trump to determine</p>


<p>// order, as described in the spec.</p>


<p><b>bool</b> Card_less(<b>const</b> Card &amp;a, <b>const</b> Card &amp;b, <b>const</b> std::string &amp;trump);</p>


<p></p>


<p>For this function are we only considering the trump suit as the determining factor in whether a &lt; b or vice versa? </p>

-------------------------------------------------
<p>As I understand it, you should make use of the boolean operator functions in addition to trump in order for Card_less to function as intended.  To get an idea of what this means you can check the middle diagram in the card hierarchy image in the project spec under "scoring".  </p>

-------------------------------------------------

<p>Attempted to run the pack public tests and im confused why its showing error instead of pass or fail.</p>

-------------------------------------------------
<p>Is there other output besides this? "ERROR" probably means your Pack implementation crashed while the test was running. This could've occurred due to a failed assertion in one of your Pack functions, a segmentation fault, etc. There should be more output (like an exception message) below these "ERROR" messages.</p>

-------------------------------------------------
<p>In the Pack function deal_one(), the assert (empty() == false) is failing, which means empty() is returning true.

shuffle()
<p>I've gotten through most of shuffle, where I made a temporary array and put the shuffled deck into that array, and when I use my visual debugger, it appears that my temporary array is shuffled correctly. However, once I go to copy the elements back over to the cards array, it doesn't seem to me working, and the cards array is not showing up in my visual debugger for me to try and determine what the issue is. All I did was use a for loop to go through each element and did cards[i] = tempArr[i]. This is what I'm getting from the public tests, as if the array is just empty. Any thoughts?

In operator<= interpretation of "card"
<p>Does the "Returns true if lhs is lower value than rhs or the same <strong>card</strong> as rhs" refer to the rank only, or rank AND suit (within the operator&lt;= function of card.cpp)? For example, does it mean a 10 of hearts is the same as a 10 of diamonds, OR is a 10 of hearts the same as a 10 of diamonds.</p>

-------------------------------------------------
It should consider both rank and suit. A 10 of hearts is only equal to a 10 of hearts.

testing question
<p>If i wanted to test the make trump function. Could I copy the exact hand in the instructions PDF, and the result of whether the player would pass? and make my tests off of that? or would that not be allowed? should I make my own unique hands? this would not be an HC violation?</p>

-------------------------------------------------
<div class="markdown" id="q38kRj58oo0ooY"><p>You can test that hand! Additionally, you can test (and <strong>use</strong>) any examples provided in lecture, specs, office hours, etc. from the professors/IAs.</p></div>

simple player, make_trump, what does it mean by same color?
<p>"During round two, a Simple Player considers ordering up the suit with the same color as the upcard, which would make that suit trump. They will order up if that would mean they have one or more cards that are either face or ace cards of the trump suit in their hand (the right and left bowers, and Q, K, A of the order-up suit)."</p>


<p></p>


<p>The description is a little bit confusing here. For example, if the upcard is Dimond, and the player has King of Dimond, he will order up Dimond? And if he has King of Hear, he will order Heart? "Same" color implies that he has two choices?</p>

-------------------------------------------------
<p>"Same" color implies that he only has 1 choice, which is the suit that is not the upcard.</p>


<p></p>


<p>So in your example, if the upcard is Diamond, only Hearts will be considered during the 2nd round</p>

Deal one
<p>In the deal one function, I should assume that I should be able to deal from wherever I am in the pack correct? If so, how can I keep track of where I am in the deck? Or whenever we deal one, will we always be at the beginning of the pack and the first card will always be the nine of spades? </p>

-------------------------------------------------
<div class="markdown" id="q38kRj58oo0ooY"><p>Per the <code>deal_one()</code> RME:</p>
<p>// REQUIRES: cards remain in the Pack <br/>
// EFFECTS: Returns the next card in the pack and increments the next index <br/>
Card deal_one();</p>
<p>So, you should be dealing from wherever you are in the pack. It is your job to use the <code>Pack</code> private member variables as a means of tracking where to deal from.</p></div>

Concise Coding
<p>Hiya! </p>


<p>I'm not the best at all with C++, but I feel like I have way too many if/else statements and for loops in my code. I checked my pseudocode in office hours and they said it was fine, but I was wondering if there is a more simple way to do this? This screenshot is make_trump from my derived class Simple : public Player in Player.ccp. </p>

<p></p>

-------------------------------------------------
<p>A lot of this kinda stuff you just get better at the more you program. At the end of the day, complex software has a lot of nested conditions you need to evaluate. There's no real way to get around that. But some strategies I use to try and reduce to "compact-tify" code are:</p>


<ol><li>Move chunks of code like "for" loops into a separate helper function</li><li>Move if-blocks outside the if-statement</li></ol>


<p></p>


<p>For the 2nd point, and example would be converting:</p>


<pre>for() {
  if(cond) {
    block
  }
}</pre>
<p>to:</p>


<pre>for() {
  if(!cond) continue;
  block
}</pre>
<p>There's a lot of little tricks like that which you'll pick up over time. I wouldn't stress about it too much, but be on the lookout for opportunities like that and you'll improve gradually. </p>

Do simple players automatically reject taking the upcard when making Trump?
<p>If a simple player is dealer and a player orders up during the first round, does the simple player automatically reject taking the upcard and keep their hand as is?</p>

-------------------------------------------------
<p>From the spec, under Adding the Upcard and Discarding a Card for a Simple Player:</p>


<p></p>


<p>If the trump suit is ordered up during round one, the dealer PICKS UP the upcard. The dealer then discards the lowest card in their hand, <em>even if this is the upcard</em>, for a final total of five cards. (Note that at this point, the trump suit is the suit of the upcard.)</p>

How to use next private variable
<p>What exactly is the purpose of "next" private var in Pack? I understand we're supposed to reset the this var and increment it at some point, but should we be using it in our logic for shuffle and/or empty or is it something we'll end up using later down the line instead?</p>

-------------------------------------------------
<p><kbd>next</kbd> stores the index of the next card to be dealt, which you can also think of as the card currently at the top of the deck. When you want to deal a card, you can use <kbd>next</kbd> to figure out which card should be dealt. You can also increment it after to store the index of the next card at the top of the deck (which would then be dealt next). Hopefully this makes a little more sense as to what the purpose of <kbd>next</kbd> is in the scope of the rest of the project.</p>

shuffle() question

How primitive type is default-initialized.
<p>For example, let's say there is a private int type member and a private char type member in a class, and they are not initialized in the constructor. What value will they be default-initialized to? Thanks!</p>

-------------------------------------------------
<p>You cannot expect a default type to initialize to any certain value once it's declared. Depending on the computer, it may initialize to 0/false or it may just assume the value that was last in its place in memory. Working with an uninitiliazed primitive variable would therefore create unknown behavior. Always initialize your primitives when you can, and don't work with them until they are initialized.</p>

-------------------------------------------------
Your idea in player factory is right. The error is showing since you haven't implemented a constructor that takes in the "name" as argument. Here, you would need to add a SimplePlayer(...) { Assign name } constructor in order to achieve that. In the line class SimplePlayer: public Player, all that is happening is that SimplePlayer inherits the Player class, so in our case, we need a constructor of our own implemented for SimplePlayer specifically, in addition to all the other functions that needs to be there. The same would be the case for a Human player.

It looks like you might be missing the <code>const</code> at the end. Feel free to follow-up if this doesn’t fix the issue!</p></div>

Deal_one
I’m having a hard time understanding the deal_one function in the pack. cpp.What does it mean by returning the next card in the pack? Does the next card mean the card to be dealt? And what does it mean that it increments the next index? Does it mean that the dealing starts with cards[0] and if cards[0] is dealt then the dealing starts with cards[1]?

-------------------------------------------------
You basically have it down. You have 24 cards with indexes 0-23. You deal starting at 0 and increment some value that tracks index, which would then become 1. Next time deal is called, it will deal cards[1] and increment.

meaning of char *argv[]
<p>argv is an array of arguments. And char **argv is an equivalent way to write it. So, I think argv should be a pointer points to pointer. Is it like argv is a pointer that points to the things in it and the things in it are pointers points to some characters? Does argv here decay from an array to a pointer? If that's true, since argv contains many pointers that point to different characters, argv is pointing at different pointers at the same time or it points to the first pointer in the array.</p>

-------------------------------------------------
<div class="markdown" id="q38kRj58oo0ooY"><p>Recall that a <code>char *</code> is a c-string. This means that <code>argv</code> is an array of cstrings, but you would also not be wrong in saying that it is an array of pointers. The reason <code>char **argv</code> is also <code>char *argv[]</code> is because arrays will decay into a pointer to the first element, and since we don’t know what the size of <code>argv</code> will be, its easier to just keep a pointer to the first element. As an example, this is what the memory addresses would look like for a sample <code>euchre.exe</code> call:</p>

Screw the dealer and make_trump for simple player
<p>In the spec for simple player it says "(A Simple Player does not consider whether they are the dealer and could gain an additional trump by picking up the upcard.)" in the paragraph about round 1.</p>


<p></p>


<p>However, in the paragraph about round 2 it says "If making reaches the dealer during the second round, we invoke <em>screw the dealer</em>, where the dealer is forced to order up. In the case of screw the dealer, the dealer will always order up the suit with the same color as the upcard."</p>


<p></p>


<p>This is confusing because it says a simple player does not consider whether they are the dealer but then asks us to invoke screw the dealer. Can I please have some general clarification about this?</p>

-------------------------------------------------
<p>In the first round, the player only considers the cards in their hand. If you are the dealer and have two trumps in your hand, ordering up the suit would give you a third. The spec says to ignore this fact, and run your strategy as if you only have two trumps in your hand.</p>


<p>In the second round, the dealer is stuck (screwed), and must call a suit. They aren't allowed to call the suit that was just turned over, so the Simple strategy insists that you order up the same color suit.</p>


<p></p>


<p>i.e. don't consider dealer status in round one, but do consider it in round two if stuck.</p>

Human player make_trump()
<p>"When making trump reaches a Human Player, first print the Player’s hand. Then, prompt the user for their decision to pass or order up. The user will then enter one of the following: “Spades”, “Hearts”, “Clubs”, “Diamonds”, or “pass” to either order up the specified suit or pass. This procedure is the same for both rounds of making trump."</p>


<p></p>


<p>^pasted from the spec</p>


<p></p>


<p>This makes it sound like the user can order up any suit in the first round, but in the rules it says the players can only order up the suit that the upcard is. What one is true for this assignment?</p>

-------------------------------------------------
<div class="markdown" id="q38kRj58oo0ooY"><p>I believe that you assume the human player will only make a valid decision here.</p></div>

-------------------------------------------------
<p>We will assume that the human player will always make valid decisions that do not violate the game rules.</p>

-------------------------------------------------
<p>Then why not simplify the input to either "pass" or "make?" I'm also confused as to why there are four possible input choices.</p>

-------------------------------------------------
<div class="markdown" id="q38kRj58oo1ooY"><p>For the second round, the human should be able to pick whatever suit they want as trump (as long as it wasn’t the upcard’s suit). This is different from the Simple player.</p></div>

-------------------------------------------------
I’d recommend installing ASAN if you haven’t already which should give you more information about where the error(s) stem from (
<a href="https://eecs280staff.github.io/p1-stats/setup_asan.html" rel="noreferrer" target="_blank">https://eecs280staff.github.io/p1-stats/setup_asan.html</a>
).

-------------------------------------------------
<div class="markdown" id="q38kRj58oo0ooY"><p>To reiterate the student follow-up answer, double check that you have a <code>delete</code> for every <code>new</code>. The autograder shows errors coming from lines 362 and 497 in <code>Player_tests.cpp</code>. It looks like you aren’t deallocating the dynamic memory reserved for the cards allocated on those lines.</p></div>

-------------------------------------------------
<p>i have that. in my terminal its just hard to read, cant really decipher anything.</p>

-------------------------------------------------
Some general advice would be to make sure wherever you use new you use delete. Also, in many cases you don’t have to use dynamic memory and you can avoid these sort of errors.

get_suit(trump)
<p>I'm very confused about the functionality of this method. If I'm returning the value of the suit of the card in the end, why is the suit of the trump needed in this method call? Why not just use the get_suit() with no parameters to get the suit of the card? </p>

-------------------------------------------------
<p>Yes. As per <a data-pats="post_ref" href="1599" onclick="return PE.gotoPost('1599');">@1599</a>, it is identical to `get_suit()` except it also considers the left bower as trump.</p>

-------------------------------------------------
<p>I guess I'm still not understanding, if all you want is the suit of the card, why does it even matter what the trump suit is</p>

-------------------------------------------------
The left bower is considered the trump suit instead of its original suit when using this function, so you need to know the trump suit to deal with this.

LeakSanitizer has encountered a fatal error
<p>I'm on VSCode on WSL and I get this message every time after I run my test cases. Not sure what this means. I copy-pasted the appropriate line from the address sanitizer setup into my makefile. Any help on what this means or affects would be appreciated. Also what does the 22638 mean?</p>

-------------------------------------------------
See comments for solution; ASAN won’t run through the debugger.

-------------------------------------------------
Do you get this error when running your test cases directly? Or are you trying to use the debugger (which may be causing the issue if so)?

-------------------------------------------------
<p>I get this error when I run my test cases through the Run and Debug menu in my debugger</p>

-------------------------------------------------
Ah that likely is the issue. ASAN won’t work if you run it with the debugger. Run it directly with ./filenamehere.exe

-------------------------------------------------
<p>Thanks. Not sure how I didn't remember this happening in my tests from the last project</p>

the lead card makes all of that suit special right? not just the exact rank and suit

Yes.

Why does address sanitizer work differently on CAEN computers vs my laptop?
<p>Hey! Quick question:</p>


<p></p>


<p>On every project now, I've had code that works beautifully on my laptop but inexplicably blows up on the CAEN computers, usually due to some address sanitizer issue. I know the address sanitizer on my laptop works because I've triggered it quite a few times, but how come it doesn't raise an issue sometimes despite CAEN machines finding one?</p>


<p></p>


<p>I'm on an M1 MacBook - do I need to install some latest version of a package, or something? It makes it <em>really </em>annoying to try to debug when I can't use the visual debugger and have to go off line numbers and error tracing from terminal output.</p>


<p></p>


<p>Also, and this is the very weird part, sometimes code that passes on the CAEN computers AND my laptop will fail on the autograder. I don't see how... is there some catch-all setting I can enable to get all these errors without having to check my code in 3 places?</p>


<p></p>


<p>Thank you!</p>

<div class="markdown" id="q38kRj58oo1ooY"><p>From the <a href="https://eecs280staff.github.io/p1-stats/setup_asan.html" rel="noreferrer" target="_blank">address sanitizer tutorial</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>WARNING:</strong> The address sanitizer will not work on heavily resource limited system such as CAEN Linux.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The system is configured to not use address sanitizer. Remember to remove those flags when you compile on CAEN. Additionally, the debugger is not compatible with the address sanitizer.</p>
<p>As for the autograder/CAEN/home setup issue, I wouldn’t know why something would fail on the autograder if it passes on CAEN - everything I’ve run on CAEN works the same as AG. I believe others have had similar issues so it would be best if an instructor could take a look at your submissions.</p>
<p>Hope this helps!</p></div>

-------------------------------------------------
<p>In this case, I'm also getting a <em>completely </em>different output in the CAEN machine vs on my laptop - one of my tests fails there despite working locally.</p>

-------------------------------------------------
<p>I found <em>an issue </em>- VSCode will default-initialize variables to 0 or 1 or something when you try and use them without initializing them yourself first. CAEN and the other systems won't. I asked a couple friends and they haven't run into that issue, probably some Mac thing.</p>


<p></p>


<p>How do I turn that off?? That's a horrible feature and I can't believe it would ever be on by default.</p>

Player tests
When we write our own tests for Player.cpp, are those tests need to follow the rules as well? If I want to use add and discard card function, does this mean I need to have at least two ace or face cards of the trump suits? It can’t be I have no cards of trump suit  in hand?

-------------------------------------------------
<div class="markdown" id="q38kRj58oo0ooY"><p>You can (and probably should, for completeness) test the functions outside of the practical scope of the game, like you mentioned.

<p>The test function for Card_less yielded no error in terminal/command line, but the autograder throws a false positive (check unique name billyin)</p>


<p></p>


<p>In short, we used brute force method to list all possible combinations and test scenarios. For each of the led suit and trump suit combinations (1 out of 16), we arrange the 52 cards from least to highest, then call Card_less on each element and itself, then with every element prior. </p>


<p></p>


<p>We've manually confirmed each card sequence, the nested for-loops and all the assert functions, and we have so far been unsuccessful at debugging the problem. Assistance is direly needed and much appreciated</p>

-------------------------------------------------
<div class="markdown" id="q38kRj58oo0ooY"><p>Your test case seems almost unnecessarily complicated. When writing test cases for this class, we don’t want to test every possible card case in one test, rather split up these cases in smaller test cases. You definitely don’t need to test all 52 card lesses, and you’re not going to catch any more bugs this way either. I would recommend testing card_less with individual sets of 3-5 cards. I think your false positive will go away if you do it this way.</p></div>

value question
<p>if the lead card and trump suit are the same then are all cards of that suit (besides the left and right bower) depend on ranks for ranking?</p>

-------------------------------------------------
<div class="markdown" id="q38kRj58oo0ooY"><p>Yes, but also there is a secondary ranking system among the suits. Rank does take priority (10 of spades &gt; 9 of diamonds), but among the same rank, the suit order is</p>
<pre><code>Diamonds &gt; Clubs &gt; Hearts &gt; Spades
</code></pre><p>Therefore, a 10 of spades is less than a 10 of diamonds (assuming neither is trump). See <a href="https://eecs280staff.github.io/p3-euchre/#value-of-cards" rel="noreferrer" target="_blank">Value of Cards</a> for more information.</p></div>

Human Player parameters

<p>                    <b>int</b> round, std::string &amp;order_up_suit)</p>


<p>should we be taking in an istream instead of all these parameters?</p>

-------------------------------------------------
<div class="markdown" id="q38kRj58oo0ooY"><p>Nope. You shouldn’t change function signatures since you need them to be the same in order to override the function in the <code>Player</code> class. You can program it to read from <code>cin</code>.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>tl;dr</strong> just put <code>&lt; file_name</code> at the end of your command to read from a file for human player input</p>
</blockquote>
<p>A little lesson on the terminal and input streams:</p>
<p>There are three main input/output streams to every program:</p>
<ul><li><code>STDIN</code>, which is console input (what you type into the terminal when the program prompts you to)</li><li><code>STDOUT</code>, which is console output (what the program prints out to the terminal after you run it</li><li><code>STDERR</code>, which is another console output stream for error messages (but we won’t use this)</li></ul>
<p>When you refer to <code>cin</code> or <code>cout</code> in a C++ program, you are referring to <code>STDIN</code> and <code>STDOUT</code> respectively. As defined above, these are normally just given from terminal input and output. However, when we are executing programs, we can <strong>redirect</strong> these inputs and outputs to come from somewhere else.</p>
<ul><li>If we use <code>&lt; file_name</code> after a program name, the program will instead take the contents of <code>file_name</code> to be <code>STDIN</code>.</li><li>Similarly, if we use <code>&gt; file_name</code> after a program name, the program will print to the file (and overwrite everything in the file) instead of the terminal when we write it.</li></ul>
<p>In the tests of <code>euchre.exe</code> we will simply feed in human input through the command line using these redirects. For example, the command you would use to test <code>euchre_test50.out.correct</code> would be</p>
<pre><code>./euchre.exe pack.in noshuffle 3 Ivan Human Judea Human Kunle Human Liskov Human &lt; euchre_test50.in &gt; euchre_test50.out

Player.cpp sort clarification
<p>I just wanted to make sure, but this hint means we can call sort() on a vector and it will sort the hand from least to greatest according to the operator&lt;() function we wrote in Card.cpp right? We don't need to write any extra code? Or am I misunderstanding something? </p>


<p></p>


<p>Also in the add_and_discard function, are we supposed to call sort after we add the upcard to the hand and then call print(), since it says it should always print the cards sorted? Because wouldn't that impact the indexing for -1 if the Human wanted to discard the upcard immediately?</p>


<p><img alt="image.pngNaN" src="/redirect/s3?bucket=uploads&amp;prefix=paste%2Fkw3s00pegt2cu%2F8c0236899b42b86135243e1901dce05799e2fef5b44b11b42be538821fc60bad%2Fimage.png"/></p>

-------------------------------------------------
<p>Simply using the code provided for sort should use the comparison code you've written, so you'll be just fine there. You should be sorting the hand any time it changes, or the first time it's set up. Before any print, it should be sorted, and since this modifies the original vector itself, you can use the new indices that the user inputs. The -1 should probably be a special check, as calling hand[-1] will crash.</p>


<p>When prompting the user, you should be displaying the 5 cards in their hand, and the -1 is giving them the option to ignore the upcard. You shouldn't put the upcard into their hand and then expect them to discard it, that isn't how the grader expects it to be.</p>

-------------------------------------------------
<p>But doesn't this mean that they do have the option to discard the upcard? If I sort before printing and the player does want to discard the upcard then we would have to iterate throughout the vector to find the card that matches the upcard and discard it, is that right? </p>


<p></p>


<p>But then how does that work, if I sort the vector and the upcard is at position 3, is the Human supposed to input 3 or -1 to discard the upcard then? </p>


<p><img alt="image.pngNaN" src="/redirect/s3?bucket=uploads&amp;prefix=paste%2Fkw3s00pegt2cu%2Fef3fc2e4953e473f7c86f26820baf9eed0fe43199495fd32cc471b01b22ab333%2Fimage.png"/></p>

-------------------------------------------------
You should display the five cards in the dealer’s hand, and that’s all. Don’t pick up the upcard into the hand first, let the user pick which card they want to discard (0-4) and if it’s -1, don’t do any swap. If they pick a card, switch out the one they chose for the upcard.

False positive on one of my Player_tests that still seems correct to me.
<p>My uniqname is "colinha", if it helps to look up my code.</p>


<p>I'm not sure if I'm allowed to share anything about my test cases, but I submitted a test to the autograder checking some edge case behavior with the bowers and the lead card. I've looked at the circumstance many times, it passes on my code, and seems to be the correct result according to spec. However, I'm getting a false positive on the autograder. I don't have any ASAN warnings so I don't believe it's some sort of undefined behavior problem, and I'm still almost certain I wrote the test case correctly, but I'm not sure how to proceed here.</p>

-------------------------------------------------
<div class="markdown" id="q38kRj58oo0ooY"><p>To answer your first question, you can’t really share anything specific about your test cases.</p>
<p>Have you tried testing your code on <a href="https://eecs280staff.github.io/p1-stats/setup_caen.html" rel="noreferrer" target="_blank">CAEN Linux</a>? This is the closest env we have to the autograder and may help you smooth out some bugs before the actual submission. From other posts here, it seems a likely culprit is using variables before they’re given a value (i.e. some compilers may set an <code>int</code> at 0 if it isn’t given a value while others leave it as random memory).</p></div>

-------------------------------------------------
<div class="markdown" id="q38kRj58oo2ooY"><p>From looking at the test case that reports a false positive, I think you would expect the player to lead with the Nine of Hearts. With the trump suit as Spades, this is the only non-trump card that the player has. Recall that the Simple Player strategy for leading a trick is as follows:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"When a Simple Player leads a trick, they play the highest non-trump card in their hand. If they have only trump cards, they play the highest trump card in their hand.</p>
</blockquote></div>

-------------------------------------------------
<p>Thanks for the reply, I tried running on CAEN (after a weird run-in with it not building and then something about it wanting to report me for some incident?), and the tests all passed, no problems.

<p>Suppose we have two cards (lhs = jack of clubs, rhs = ace of clubs):<br/>
Your implementation currently would first check <code>if("jack" &lt; "ace")</code>, doing a comparison between the two strings. This fails to consider the actual ordering of ranks that we define.

Note that the sort function modifies the hand. You cannot modify member variables in a const function, so you’ll receive a compiler error if you call sort in a const member function.<br/><br/>
You shouldn’t need to sort using card less. When you print the hand in order it should be sorted using the &lt; operator. You could sort with card less when determining what action to take, but you should be able to find the min/max card in the hand without sorting. You could use a functor to sort using card less, but those are only covered later in the course. Generally: if you need to use sort, just the default one will be fine.</p>

-------------------------------------------------
<p>Yeah, that helped a bit. For the make_trump function, how are we supposed to sort the hand before it is printed since it is a const function? </p>

-------------------------------------------------
<div class="markdown" id="q38kRj58oo1ooY"><p>I would try to think of it in terms of when a player’s hand would be changed such that it needs to be sorted. If you sort the hand wherever it is modified, is it necessary to sort in <code>make_trump</code>? This also resolves the issue of const vs. non-const functions; if a hand is being modified somewhere, it can also be sorted.</p></div>

Add_and_discard. seeing if suit is ordered up during round 1
<p>the spec for add_and_discard depends on whether or not the trump suit is ordered up during round 1. How do we figure out if this happened since the trump suit is ordered in round 1 or 2 in the function make_trump?</p>

-------------------------------------------------
<div class="markdown" id="q38kRj58oo0ooY"><p>If the trump suit was ordered up in round 1, call <code>add_and_discard</code>. If it wasn’t ordered up in round 1, don’t call <code>add_and_discard</code>. This logic should be in <code>euchre.cpp</code>, the driver file.</p></div>

Using sort in Simple Player
<p>Are we allowed to use std::sort in Simple Player? Additionally, how exactly is it sorting the cards?</p>

-------------------------------------------------
<div class="markdown" id="q38kRj58oo0ooY"><p>Yes, we are allowed to use <code>std::sort</code> - though I don’t believe that it is checked and needs to be  an invariant like Human Player. Calling</p>
<pre><code>std::sort(hand.begin(), hand.end());
</code></pre><p>will just sort <code>hand</code> using the <code>&lt;</code> operator, which does not consider trump or the led card. If you want to sort with a different function, there is the overload</p>
<pre><code>void sort( RandomIt first, RandomIt last, Compare comp );
</code></pre><p>Where <code>comp</code> is simply a function that takes in two arguments and returns true if the first argument is less than the second argument. More details <a href="https://en.cppreference.com/w/cpp/algorithm/sort" rel="noreferrer" target="_blank">here</a>.</p></div>

play_card trump question.
<p>I am unsure where to use the variable trump that is passed into play_card for simple player. The specs say "If a Simple Player can follow suit, they play the highest card that follows suit. Otherwise, they play the lowest card in their hand." </p>


<p></p>


<p>Doesn't this only rely on led_card, and cant you determine highest card that follows suit without using trump? </p>


<p></p>

-------------------------------------------------
<div class="markdown" id="q38kRj58oo0ooY"><p>If the player doesn’t have the led suit, then the player will need to use trump to determine what their lowest card is. For example, if Spades is trump and diamonds were led, and the players hand is just the 9 of spades and the 10 of hearts, the player knowing the trump suit would play the 10 of hearts instead of the 9 of spades even though the rank is technically lower.</p></div>

-------------------------------------------------
<p>Why do we want to play 10 of hearts, even though 9 of spades is lower?</p>


<p></p>


<p>In the same case where the Player doesn't have a led suit, when do we specifically consider the lowest card in their hand?</p>

-------------------------------------------------
<p>Because the trump suit is Spades, this automatically makes the 9 of spades higher than any other card, besides the right bower and any other spades that is higher.</p>


<p></p>

<p></p>


<p>refer to the image that shows the rank of the cards when there is a trump and led suit. </p>


<p></p>


<p>As to your second question, if the simple player doesnt have a led suit, you always consider the lowest card in their hand because that is what they are going to play.  This is only for the simple player, for human player, they can decide to play any card. </p>

confused about pack constructors
<p>I am very confused about pack constructors. From what I understand, for the default constructor, we have to initialize each element in the cards array to be in order from 9 of spades to the ace of diamonds. and we have to manually initlaize each element in cards array. I have a nested for loop to loop through and making the cards in order using the ranks by weight and suits by weight arrays. but I don't understand how to use an initializer list when using loops. </p>


<p></p>


<p></p>

-------------------------------------------------
<div class="markdown" id="q38kRj58oo0ooY"><p>It is not required to use an initializer list for adding Cards to the <code>cards</code> array.

Issues with add_card function indexing out of bounds.
<p><img alt="" height="701" src="/redirect/s3?bucket=uploads&amp;prefix=paste%2Fkswgj8nsvjm1sp%2F724d2ca2add2a5f531dbc1378929ddc8a284c2c1bb4f74400279152ebe738688%2FEECS_280.PNG" width="775"/></p>


<p></p>


<p>Not sure why my add_card function isn't working but for some reason it is indexing out of bounds. I used cout statements to output the name of the player and how many cards are in their hand every time the add_card function is ran. As you can see above, those statements are only ran once before the error pops up. In my function I am indexing a vector of Cards with the variable "numOfCardsInHand" (which is what is being outputted) to add a card to the vector. I'm pretty sure the issue isn't with initialization because my constructor works for the other tests and I am seeing the correct output the first time add_card is being run. I've tried using the debugger, but I can't seem to find the member variables on the local variable list. It should be indexing at 0, so I don't know why that is an issue. My only guess is that it's not exactly 0, but some random small memory junk number, but I'm not sure.</p>

-------------------------------------------------
How are you adding cards to the hand? If you try to index at 0 in an empty vector it'll throw an out of bounds error. If you're not already, can you try using push _back?

play_card example
<p>Suppose the led suit is diamonds and the trump is hearts.

RESOLVED, ignore
<p>I wrote code in shuffle that can properly do one in shuffle. But the spec says that shuffle() has to do seven in shuffles itself so I'm trying to put my in shuffle in a loop, but I don't understand why its not working out.</p>


<p>This is the one in shuffle that works:</p>


<p><img alt="image.png" src="/redirect/s3?bucket=uploads&amp;prefix=paste%2Fksxpu49nau04mz%2Ff67e9c38a1846b1f9c6f1e72e6137b05d52b2f86e501cd642eee6d2f0cfad90a%2Fimage.png"/></p>


<p>But this one fails:</p>

<p>The public test is saying that my first card is Nine of Clubs regardless of how many loops I do, so I don't understand why it stops changing after the first loop</p>

confusion on round 2 of simple player make trump
<p>can someone explain round 2 of make trump for the simple player? they chose to upcard if they have 1 or more cards of the upcard's next suit? but what if they have the same suit as upcard? and what about the right and left bower of the upcard suit?</p>

-------------------------------------------------
<div class="markdown" id="q38kRj58oo0ooY"><p>For the second round of make trump, you only consider the upcard’s next suit. The right and left bower of the upcard’s next suit count as the upcard’s next suit.</p></div>

-------------------------------------------------
<div class="markdown" id="q38kRj58oo0ooY"><p>Ah, I see. So you’re trying to sort the hand on line 135 of Player.cpp - this is an invalid operation because <code>make_trump</code> is const. You cannot call sort specifically in this function - you have to sort somewhere where you don’t have the const restriction.</p></div>

how can you remove an element from an array?
<p>or how do i move it to the back?</p>

-------------------------------------------------
<div class="markdown" id="q38kRj58oo0ooY"><p>For a <code>std::array</code>, there is no easy way to remove an element from an array in one step. You’d likely have to make another array of smaller size and copy everything but your excluded element into there.</p>
<p>To instead move an element to the back, you’d just have to swap two elements of the array(the target element and the last element). To implement this, you’d get a variable to store the value of the target, then make the value at the target location in the array the same as the end of the array, and finally make the value at the end of the array the variable you stored before (or do something similar).</p>
<p>If you instead use a vector, it’s much easier. Just do <code>vector_name.erase(vector_name.begin() + index_to_erase)</code>. More details <a href="https://en.cppreference.com/w/cpp/container/vector/erase" rel="noreferrer" target="_blank">here</a>.</p></div>

For example, if trump is hearts and the led card is the ten of diamonds, the jack of diamonds (left bower) is not part of the led suit and cannot be played if you have any other diamonds.</p></div>

what does the sort function do since we are sortiing cards not ints?

-------------------------------------------------
<div class="markdown" id="q38kRj58oo0ooY"><p>The <code>sort</code> function works the same for <code>int</code>s and <code>Card</code>s, actually - it just performs a sort using the <code>&lt;</code> operator to determine what values are smaller than others. The only change here is that we overload the <code>&lt;</code> operator in <code>Card.cpp</code> to tell the function how we want <code>Card</code>s to be compared.</p></div>

Player Cosntructor
<p>Hi, I am a little stuck in terms of how to get Player started. I understand that I need to make a simple and a human player derived class from the player class. However, does this mean I have to implement a default constructor for Player? I am just a little confused on where to start. Thanks.</p>

-------------------------------------------------
<div class="markdown" id="q38kRj58oo0ooY"><p>You will not have to do anything for the base <code>Player</code> class. The compiler will implicitly make a blank <code>Player()</code> constructor and call it in your derived classes. You will have to make constructors for your human and simple player classes, but you won’t have to worry about the <code>Player</code> class constructor at all.</p></div>

Modify cin to read from .txt file
<p>I am currently writing test cases for HumanPlayer, and I've met an issue with cin. There's no console input on autograder, so I wonder how the player (autograder) inputs the card to play or drop</p>

-------------------------------------------------
<div class="markdown" id="q38kRj58oo0ooY"><p>See the lesson here: <a data-pats="post_ref" href="1816" onclick="return PE.gotoPost('1816');">@1816</a>.</p>
<p>Basically, you can change <code>STDIN</code>/<code>cin</code> from the console input to a file from the command line when calling a function by putting <code>&lt; file_in</code> at the end of your command.</p></div>

Should we test the operators?

<div class="markdown" id="q38kRj58oo0ooY"><p>Yes, it’s always better to be safe than sorry, and the operators are used in many other parts of the function so if they have something wrong with them it’s much easier to find out now than in another function where it’s buried.</p></div>

Help with understanding situation in euchre
<p>Right now, I'm trying to figure out how to play euchre and I think I mostly got it other than more a couple specific scenarios. Lets say the led card was an ace of hearts, the trump was diamonds, and in your hand was an ace of clubs, jack of diamonds, ten of spades, king of clubs, and nine of clubs. Would you have to play the jack of diamonds or could you play any card since the jack would be considered right bower and not the same suit as the led card?</p>

-------------------------------------------------
<div class="markdown" id="q38kRj58oo0ooY"><p>You would have to play the jack of diamonds since it’s technically a heart (as it’s the left bower).</p></div>

-------------------------------------------------
<p>Wouldn't the jack of diamonds be the right bower since the trump suit is diamonds and it would be considered diamonds, not hearts? I thought left and right bower were based off of what was trump.</p>

-------------------------------------------------
<div class="markdown" id="q38kRj58oo1ooY"><p>So sorry, that was my mistake, I misread it as saying the trump was hearts. You would be right, the Jack of Diamonds is a Jack (the right bower), and you would play whatever. If you are a simple player, you would play the nine of clubs.</p></div>

Error with player_factory
<p>When I try to create a new player with the player factory I get an error saying "expected a type specifier". Not sure what this means.</p>

-------------------------------------------------
It depends on how you're trying to declare the new player. You shouldn't be doing new Player since Player is an abstract class. Make sure your simple and human player classes have constructors that set the player name. When you use new, ensure it's formatted like "new SimplePlayer(name)"

Pack istream ctor
<p>Hello! I was able to successfully stream in the rank, the keyword of, and the suit for the Cards. When I ran the pack public tests, however, it came up saying that first_card is streamed in as the Two of Spades, not the Nine of Spades. Is there a way to make the istream start at nine of spades? Would I have to call a double for loop, as I currently am using a while loop.</p>

-------------------------------------------------
<div class="markdown" id="q38kRj58oo0ooY"><p>That’s odd. Are you sure that you are creating the <code>Card</code>s from only the input streamed in? In <code>pack.in</code> there isn’t a two anywhere - you should just be reading in ranks nine and up. Note that in the istream constructor you shouldn’t need to use the arrays <code>RANK_NAMES_BY_WEIGHT</code> or <code>SUIT_NAMES_BY_WEIGHT</code>.</p></div>

Question about weights of cards
<p>For determining if a card is less than the other card when doing the operator&lt;, are there steps I need to go through? For example, do I check the weight of the suit of the card first then check the rank of the card?</p>


<p></p>


<p>For example:</p>


<p>ace_spades &lt; two_hearts = false</p>


<p>ace_spades = 14 + 1 = 15</p>


<p>two_hearts = 2 + 2 = 4</p>


<p></p>


<p>Do I do simple math, or do I check first based on the suit, then go to rank?</p>


<p>four_spades&lt; two_hearts = true because hearts is a greater rank than spades based on the definition of weight of suit as shown in card.h</p>


<p></p>


<p></p>

-------------------------------------------------
<div class="markdown" id="q38kRj58oo0ooY"><p>Using math is actually kind of smart - don’t quote me on this but I think that strategy might work.</p>
<p>However, you might be a little confused on the ranking - the rank of the card takes priority, then the suit. Any four is always greater than any two. See the diagram and rules <a href="https://eecs280staff.github.io/p3-euchre/#value-of-cards" rel="noreferrer" target="_blank">here</a>.</p></div>

Shuffle test fails no matter what
<p><img alt="Screen_Shot_2022-10-08_at_11.55.29_PM.pngNaN" height="150" src="/redirect/s3?bucket=uploads&amp;prefix=paste%2Fktt6mnkjjgv19w%2F09f74d32383f1a5733ef6e15e9995769837441bac417f34d34025e2d014302ce%2FScreen_Shot_2022-10-08_at_11.55.29_PM.png" width="457"/></p>


<p>Everytime my partner and I run this test we always get this error even if we delete all of our code in shuffle itll still output that error on line 53 when there isnt even a line 53, I'm just unsure how to go about fixing this issue because the autograder wont even give us an output. </p>

-------------------------------------------------
This could be a variety of issues, including compiling an outdated file (e.g. two copies of the same file in different directories, trying to compile in the wrong one). It could also be that you need to do make clean and make Pack_public_test.exe (or "tests", I'm on mobile so I can't check). Do either of those fix it?

-------------------------------------------------
<p>unfortunately that did not work and its still outputting line 53 with nine of spades. is there anything else I could try?</p>

-------------------------------------------------
<p>I believe there is a line 53 in the Pack Public Tests which is what I believe that is referring to. This test case means after shuffling the expected first card should be the king of clubs, but you are outputting the nine of spades.</p>

make_trump false positive

<p></p>

-------------------------------------------------
<div class="markdown" id="q38kRj58oo0ooY"><p>In both cases, I think it is the second assert which is a false positive. Since the player is not ordering up any suit, trump would not be <code>SUIT_SPADES</code> or <code>SUIT_DIAMONDS</code>. You wouldn’t be able to assert that trump is a particular suit when the player does not order up.</p></div>

Test Fail--Leading Tricks in Player_tests.cpp
<p>Hi, for leading tricks in Player_tests.cpp, I consider a situation where the simple player only has trump(Hearts) cards, and he will play the leftbower(no rightbower) as the lead card right? But I continuously failed my test.<img alt="" height="72" src="/redirect/s3?bucket=uploads&amp;prefix=paste%2Fl7b69no9x5g28c%2F31eaf0b3e8b44106cc4c634d6ca60b77fa306f9441e5f14461ef43ec4afdcbb3%2Fleft.png" width="587"/></p>

<div class="markdown" id="q38kRj58oo0ooY"><p>From the spec:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“When a Simple Player leads a trick, they play the highest non-trump card in their hand. If they have only trump cards, they play the highest trump card in their hand.”</p>
</blockquote>
<p>So, you are correct that if a player only has trump cards, they would lead with the left bower if they do not have the right bower. It is hard to say exactly why this is failing, but stepping through with your debugger may help! Also, double check that you are properly comparing cards (using <code>Card_less</code>) and the correct version of <code>get_suit()</code> for the given context to determine which card is the highest.</p></div>

bool operator <
<p>I'm having errors with the bool operator &lt; function test. I believe I wrote the tests correctly, and the function seems to be working fine after debugging... what is the issue? The first Assert is failing. <img alt="Screen_Shot_2022-10-09_at_1.58.21_AM.png" src="/redirect/s3?bucket=uploads&amp;prefix=paste%2Fkt2b9bbjewsbt%2F7b52f588f83a539349437e14f008bc9332e04b3e49399eb85861c6be8a27d58d%2FScreen_Shot_2022-10-09_at_1.58.21_AM.png"/><img alt="Screen_Shot_2022-10-09_at_1.58.32_AM.png" src="/redirect/s3?bucket=uploads&amp;prefix=paste%2Fkt2b9bbjewsbt%2Fab8cbc4ccdee9e6aad325eb026431d55acdcfd0ca70c0428043d507949ac11d3%2FScreen_Shot_2022-10-09_at_1.58.32_AM.png"/></p>

-------------------------------------------------
This is because the comparison is happening between 2 string values. lhs.get_rank() will return "Two" and rhs.get_rank() will return "Six". Alphabetically, S comes before T, hence Six (i e. Card b) is coming out to be lesser. 
<div>Would recommend giving the ranks and suits a weight (an integer) which will be helpful in comparing as right now they are just being compared alphabetically. </div>

-------------------------------------------------
<p>Should I put the integer weight in the constructors, or specifically the overloading operator function?</p>

-------------------------------------------------
In the operator function. If you need, you can even create a helper function for weights and call that in your overloading operator function 
<div>P.S. Do take a look at the Rank_names_by_weight and the suit_names_by_weight array defined in Card.h</div>

Should I add virtual ~Player() {} in the derived class?
<p>Hi, I just submitted my project. For the two derived classes, I wrote one ending with</p>


<div>
<div>~SimplePlayer() {}. I don't know what it is for. Should I add
<div>
<div>~SimplePlayer() {} OR ~Player() {} at the end of each derived class?</div>
</div>
</div>
</div>


<p></p>

-------------------------------------------------
<div class="markdown" id="q38kRj58oo0ooY"><p>You shouldn’t need to add either, a tilde (~) before a class name as a function means that that is a destructor - or a function called when the class member is deleted.

Play Card Edge Case
<p>Say the players hand is as follows: Ace of Clubs, Ten of Clubs, Jack of Diamonds, Nine of Hearts, and Ace of Hearts.</p>


<p></p>


<p>Suppose that the led card's suit is hearts and that the trump suit is hearts as well.</p>


<p></p>


<p>I was confused whether or not the player is forced to play their Jack of Diamonds in their scenario.</p>


<p></p>


<p>I understand that since hearts is the trump, the Jack of Diamonds (left bower) is considered hearts as well.</p>


<p></p>


<p>Does this mean they have to play the Jack of Diamonds, given that it is the highest card they have with the same suit as the led card?</p>


<p></p>

-------------------------------------------------
<div class="markdown" id="q38kRj58oo0ooY"><p>You are correct. The jack of diamonds is the highest card in their hand right now, it is trump, and it is a heart. After trump is declared, the left bower is for all cases within the game considered the trump suit.</p></div>

confused about wording for making trump round 2
<p>"During round two, a Simple Player considers ordering up the suit with the same color as the upcard, which would make that suit trump. They will order up if that would mean they have one or more cards that are either face or ace cards of the trump suit in their hand (the right and left bowers, and Q, K, A of the order-up suit). For example, if the upcard is a Heart and the player has the King of Diamonds in their hand, they will order up Diamonds. The Simple Player will not order up any other suit."</p>


<p></p>


<p>My understanding is:</p>


<p>during the second round, simple player only orders up if &gt;= 2 of their cards have the same suit as the upcard. I'm a bit confused about the "for example... they will order up diamonds" part.</p>


<p></p>


<p>But, say that the upcard is heart and the player has the king of diamond, wouldn't that require us to return false while keeping the order_up_suit undeclared?</p>

-------------------------------------------------
<p>In round 2, the suit of the upcard is no longer in consideration for trump. Essentially, players are deciding if the suit that is the same color as the upcard will be trump. They will make that suit trump if &gt;= 1 of their cards is a face or ace card of that suit. If these conditions are met in round 2 (or the conditions to choose trump are fulfilled in round 1), make_trump will return true. Order_up_suit will be set to the suit that is chosen as trump, which is the upcard suit in round 1 or the suit that is the same color as the upcard in round 2. </p>


<p></p>


<p>In the example, diamonds is chosen as trump because diamonds is the same color as hearts (the upcard) and the player has at least one face or ace card in their hand.</p>


<p></p>


<p></p>

-------------------------------------------------
<p>(not original poster) let's say its round 2 and its the dealer's turn and they don't have the same color as the trump. what do we return then ?</p>

-------------------------------------------------
<p>If its the dealer and round 2, they will call up the same color suit as trump even if they don't have any.</p>

how do I define a function inside a class in Card.h outside the class in Card.cpp??
<p>I am confused with how I would define the functions inside the Card.h file in my Card.cpp file. I am not declaring a Class in my cpp file right? Then how can I define a constructor? In lecture, we only learned how to define constructor inside the class itself, not outside of it in a separate file. Or am I missing something? A little help would be really appreciated.</p>

-------------------------------------------------
<div class="markdown" id="q38kRj58oo0ooY"><p>You use the scope resolution operator <code>::</code> to tell the compiler what you are actually talking about. For example, in <code>Card.cpp</code> to declare the constructor for <code>Card</code>, you would write</p>
<pre><code>Card::Card() {}
</code></pre><p>as your function signature to tell the compiler you are declaring the function <code>Card()</code> in the class <code>Card</code> rather than the global scope in <code>Card.cpp</code>.</p></div>

-------------------------------------------------
<p>That was helpful, thanks. Part of my question was also: How do I define a new constructor inside the class if I am just defining the function outside the class? Or do I not need it for this project?</p>

-------------------------------------------------
<div class="markdown" id="q38kRj58oo1ooY"><p>You shouldn’t need more than the two constructors in <code>Card.h</code>. However, if you were to create another constructor, you would need to change the <code>Card.h</code> file to include this constructor’s signature. In this project, we are not allowed to modify the header files, but if you could, you would add your new constructor signature there and then define it in <code>Card.cpp</code> accordingly.</p>
<p>For example:</p>
<pre><span class="hljs-comment">// --Card.h--</span>
<span class="hljs-comment">// our new constructor</span>
Card(<span class="hljs-built_in">std</span>::<span class="hljs-built_in">string</span>&amp; suit);

Writing Test Cases
<p>I'm not sure how to go about writing test cases for simple player, any hints or suggestions?</p>

-------------------------------------------------
<div class="markdown" id="q38kRj58oo0ooY"><p>You should set up a game of euchre in your test cases with different hands for the player and see if they play the right cards given the situations. If you’re having trouble, you could always get a deck of cards or find one online and actually deal out a game of euchre to see what real situations would look like and how the flow of the game works.</p></div>

Autograder for checkpoint
Me and my partner have been working on the project despite not being paired on the autograder. The reason for this is because my partner had a different partner who dropped the class. We still haven’t heard back about when we’ll be able to register our new partnership on the autograder. Will we be able to before the checkpoint is due? And if we aren’t, should I just submit it individually? My partner has been submitting it, so I think if I submit it as well it’ll probably set off the plagiarism checker.
<p></p>

<div class="markdown" id="q38kRj58oo0ooY"><p>I would email eecs280staff@umich.edu for logistical issues like this as soon as you can so we can fix that for you. Yes, that may set off the plagiarism checker if you’re not partnered on autograder.</p></div>

Adding the Upcard and Discarding in human player
<p>is_dealer and round number isnt an argument for add_and_discard so how do we implement these aspects?</p>


<div>
<div></div>
</div>

-------------------------------------------------
<div class="markdown" id="q38kRj58oo0ooY"><p>You shouldn’t need to know these for <code>add_and_discard</code>. Add and discard is agnostic of what round the trump was called in, how it was called, etc. - It just considers the card passed as an argument and asks the human to get rid of one card in their hand.</p></div>

-------------------------------------------------
<p>but the spec says </p>


<h4>Adding the Upcard and Discarding<a href="https://eecs280staff.github.io/p3-euchre/#adding-the-upcard-and-discarding" rel="noreferrer" target="_blank"></a></h4>


<p><strong>If a Human Player is the dealer and someone orders up during the first round of making, the Human Player will pick up the upcard and discard a card of</strong> their choice. Print the Player’s hand and an option to discard the upcard. Then, prompt the user to select a card to discard. The user will then enter the number corresponding to the card they want to discard (or -1 if they want to discard the upcard).</p>

-------------------------------------------------
<div class="markdown" id="q38kRj58oo1ooY"><p>This logic does not need to be in <code>add_and_discard</code>, the checking for this will be done in <code>euchre.cpp</code>. <code>add_and_discard</code> behaves with no knowledge of the state of the game other than the trump suit.</p></div>

Pack Order after Hand
<p>What should be the pack order after a hand is played? Should the pack order reset to the order from the file provided before shuffling to start the second hand?</p>

-------------------------------------------------
<div class="markdown" id="q38kRj58oo0ooY"><p>In <a href="https://eecs280staff.github.io/p3-euchre/#shuffle" rel="noreferrer" target="_blank">EECS 280 Euchre Rules</a>, the spec says to shuffle the deck at the start of every hand. This is true unless <code>noshuffle</code> is specified, in which case you just reset the deck after every hand to what it initially was.</p></div>

-------------------------------------------------
<p>So just to clarify, what order will the pack be in before we call shuffle at the start of the second hand?</p>

-------------------------------------------------
<div class="markdown" id="q38kRj58oo1ooY"><p>The same order it was in at the start of the first hand. Throughout the course of a trick, the order of the pack does not change. It is only shuffled and reset at the start of tricks.</p></div>

'SimplePlayer' does not name a type

-------------------------------------------------
<div class="markdown" id="q38kRj58oo0ooY"><p>Make sure you didn’t define the SimplePlayer class in the header file! When you run your code on your machine and on CAEN, it’s using your header files exactly, but ofc when you upload to AG it only uses your cpp files and uses the original header files.
Hope this helps.</p></div>

How do I find the card I'm supposed to deal for deal_one()
<p>Hello! I'm currently working on the deal_one() function, and I'm wondering how I'm supposed to get the info on what the next card or current card is. After all, this thing is supposed to return the current card if I'm correct, but I don't know what function or value is supposed to help me find said card. If you know anything that could help with this, that'd be great.</p>

-------------------------------------------------
<div class="markdown" id="q38kRj58oo0ooY"><p>The private variable <code>next</code> in <code>Pack</code> should specify the index of the top-most card (the next card to be dealt). You should update this each time you deal a card and reset it when you shuffle or reset the deck.</p></div>

-------------------------------------------------
<p>Would an "empty" pack then be a pack where next is 25, and therefore all cards have been dealt</p>

-------------------------------------------------
<div class="markdown" id="q38kRj58oo1ooY"><p>You’re on the right track! Double check which number specifically that would be.</p></div>

What to return for lead_card and play_card
When I try to compile player.cpp it tells me that I need to have a return statement for lead_card and play_card and I would assume we are supposed to return the card we find. However, we are also supposed to erase that card from the hand. So how do I both return the card and erase the card?

-------------------------------------------------
<p>store the card you want to play in a new card that you create in the function and store the index of that card in another variable as well. then you can delete the card from the hand then return the card variable you created.</p>

<p></p>

-------------------------------------------------
<p>Feel free to post a screenshot of the error if you are still having trouble, but in general, a lot of errors related to player factory have to do with not having all of the functions from Player.h implemented in both classes. You also should have a constructor so make sure you are calling it correctly in Player_factory, but it should be the same or close to the same as what's in the spec depending on how many parameters you pass into your constructor.</p>

<p>1. Why do we need to Initializes Card to the Two of Spades? </p>


<p></p>


<p>I watched the video but didn't quite get the point that why do we need to start from spades.</p>


<p></p>


<p>2. My partner and I are still confusing about the get_suit <b>(const</b> std::string &amp;trump) <b>const functioin,</b></p>


<p><b></b></p>


<p>I understand the hint but when i try to implement it, I call get_suit directly (get_suit(trump))then i got an error: "</p>


<p>All paths through this function will call itself", my guess is that my syntax is wrong...but I am not sure what syntax is right...</p>


<p></p>


<p>"left bower: The Jack from the other suit of the same color as the <em>Trump</em> suit, considered the second highest-valued card in Euchre. The <em>Left Bower</em> is also considered a <em>Trump</em> card."</p>


<p></p>


<p>If i do string suit = get_suit(); then i will know the suit of the card being initialized, but according to the def of left bower, it looks like I need to get the color of trump??? since the left bower is the jack with the same color as trump suit??? Then i need to do several if loop to decide what i want to return here...(hopefully these are all overthinking and there's a simpler way...)</p>


<p></p>


<p>similarly we also haven't implemented the is_left_bower;</p>


<p></p>


<p>3. The spec says we are gonna use polymorphysm in this proj, Is card our base class then others inherited from it? </p>


<p></p>


<p>4.how do i solve this error in pack...<img alt="" src="/redirect/s3?bucket=uploads&amp;prefix=paste%2Fksxfxo1r1f877a%2Fa7a5e52e2a6abf488fe104e103a84457297e2abea48bee71f0c93f61f67334f1%2FScreen_Shot_2022-10-09_at_4.44.48_PM.png"/></p>

-------------------------------------------------
<p>And also do i need to call get_rank before my code decide if card is a face card (Jack, Queen, King or Ace) in Card::is_face_or_ace()?</p>

-------------------------------------------------
<p>You can, but you can also access rank directly</p>

<p>can i just do rank==RANK_QUEEN, etc.?</p>

-------------------------------------------------
<div class="markdown" id="q38kRj58oo1ooY"><p>Well, yes you could check this way (is rank ace || is rank king || is rank etc etc), but there are more elegant solutions possible. Look in the header file for card and try to see how you could use provided arrays to check with a single statement.
At the end of the day, that method would work but if you’re looking for a better way there is one I have in mind.</p></div>

<p>According to google, it seems like you tried to create a string bigger than std::string::max_size(). I'm actually not quite sure where this happens, but maybe this question is better suited for office hours so we can look at your code more directly?</p>

compiler reading card Constructor weirdly
<p>I can't really tell what is going on here and was wondering if I could get some guidance. When I run my Player public test, the card constructor runs twice, the first time it works, but the second time (which I don't know why it happens) just skips the lines of code and creates an empty card. Could I get some guidance on this? Thanks.</p>

<p>It looks like on the autograder your player public tests are working now...if it is not please follow up on this post for more guidance. I can not watch the videos. If the problem is not fixed, please post screen shots of the error message and I can look at your code on the autograder. </p>

Creating classes in .cpp
<p>I understand we're not supposed to modify header files for this class, but I don't understand why we would then be told to declare classes inside a .cpp file -- it's generally considered bad practice as it removes a layer of protection from the class. I get that this is meant to prevent us from accidentally modifying the classes, but I feel at this point, we really should be capable of implementing a class correctly, with declarations and implementations in separate files as it should be. I'm not saying this to be critical, but it's just one or two extra files, which wouldn't be much extra work for the autograder to check or any of us to write, and it would also be good just for us to be familiar with writing code for classes in the way it's typically implemented professionally. Just a suggestion!</p>

Going over MAX_HAND_SIZE in add_and_discard()
<p>How do we account for adding a card, which would change the max hand size to 6, before removing the card in add_and_discard?</p>

-------------------------------------------------
<p>Instead of adding the card first, find the card you are going to remove, and just swap it with what you are adding. No need to use erase() or what not I believe, that should only have to be used in lead_card and play_card since you don't pick up a card.</p>

Possible Issue with static and dynamic memory
<p>In testing Player.cpp, I am using a helper function that returns the player's hand:</p>


<p><img alt="Screen_Shot_2022-10-09_at_6.09.41_PM.png" height="74" src="/redirect/s3?bucket=uploads&amp;prefix=paste%2Fl7ksdbjv4ns6ni%2F269e8fdaa7ada4d595effd92ee44b44c31b7be0ea47a57e4ff5486f81360533c%2FScreen_Shot_2022-10-09_at_6.09.41_PM.png" width="299"/></p>


<p>This is my code in Player_tests: (I have made a SimplePlayer named roger that has five cards in his hand)</p>


<p><img alt="Screen_Shot_2022-10-09_at_6.10.20_PM.png" height="32" src="/redirect/s3?bucket=uploads&amp;prefix=paste%2Fl7ksdbjv4ns6ni%2F06caee5b82499274022f03134da54c138baf3d9520913345f233ff44c5792974%2FScreen_Shot_2022-10-09_at_6.10.20_PM.png" width="385"/></p>


<p>The compiler tells me that " class Player has no member "get_hand()" "</p>


<p>I think this is an issue with dynamic vs static memory. As far as I know, roger's static type is Player but Dynamic type is SimplePlayer. Doesn't that mean that roger should have access to get_hand()? What could be the issue here?</p>

-------------------------------------------------
<p>It's telling you that the Player class doesn't have the member function get hand, which it doesn't -- its a helper function that you created. In order for this function to work, you have to put the word static in front of it. This will give the function internal linkage, so it won't throw that linking error. Get_hand by itself doesn't have access to the class variables because it's not declared inside the class (its a helper function), so you have to first declare it inside of simple player, and then define it inside then file like so.</p>

<p></p>


<p>static const vector&lt;Card&gt; &amp; Player::get_hand() const</p>

For Card::Card() and Card::Card(const std::string &rank_in, const std::string &suit_in)
<p>Should we be calling get_rank() and get_suit() for these two functions or can we call rank and suit?</p>

-------------------------------------------------
<p>If you look in Card.h file, the Card class has two private member variables, rank and suit. You can set these equal to the rank and suit you want in Card() and Card(rank_in, suit_in). No need to call get_rank() and get_suit(). </p>

-------------------------------------------------
<p>So I tried doing</p>


<p></p>


<p>Card Card(rank_in, suit_int);</p>


<p></p>


<p>so that the default constructor can take this value and set the members accordingly. But it isn't working. What am I doing wrong here?</p>

-------------------------------------------------
<p>You should just set the variables rank and suit equal to rank_in and suit_in individually. What you are doing now is trying to call the Card constructor you are writing into itself. However, you will call the Card constructor like in your comment in Pack.cpp</p>

Lead card with trump parameter
<p>This might be a silly question but what do we do with the trump input in lead_card? I accounted for trump in my card_less function so I'm not sure how to implement trump into the lead_card function in Player.cpp.</p>

-------------------------------------------------
<div class="markdown" id="q38kRj58oo0ooY"><p>As the <a href="https://eecs280staff.github.io/p3-euchre/#leading-tricks" rel="noreferrer" target="_blank">spec describes</a>, the <code>SimplePlayer::lead_card()</code> function will:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>play the highest non-trump card in their hand. If they have only trump cards, they play the highest trump card in their hand.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Implementing this requires checking if there is a trump card in the hand, and then taking the appropriate action. If there are any non-trump cards, play the lowest card. If there are only trump cards, play the highest trump card. The <code>trump</code> input is used for each of these steps.</p></div>

-------------------------------------------------
<p>thanks! I was wondering about this primarily for the human player function as well, how would I implement trump there?</p>


<p></p>

-------------------------------------------------
<p>The human player decides what card they want to lead with, there are no restrictions because they are leading (don't have to follow suit). Just return the card the human player plays.</p>

Issues with git
<p>My partner is getting a conflict with git and can't work on the file after I merged a branch. I tried replacing the file and deleting the merge, but that did not work. Can this be fixed? </p>

-------------------------------------------------
<p>What do you mean can't work on the file? As in you both were working on the file and have a conflict in that file?</p>

-------------------------------------------------
<p>I would go to office hours here because each git error may have a different fix. An IA should be able to resolve this no problem. If OH is impossible, then you can restart a new git repository and move all of your partners files to a new project.</p>

-------------------------------------------------
<p>I have no conflicts (that shows), but my partner does</p>

Pack.cpp failing tests
<p>My partner and I submitted to autograder. We failed all the public tests and aren't sure what's wrong or if we are implementing the functions correctly.</p>

-------------------------------------------------
<p>One thing that might be causing you to fail is your Pack constructor. The next member variable is used to know what card is next to be dealt; it doesn't need to be incremented in your constructor. </p>


<p></p>


<p>Try running the Pack public tests on your own computer. Make sure the Pack you creates looks like the one in the <code>pack.in</code> file.  See which assert statements fail and use your debugger to identify what changes need to be made.</p>

-------------------------------------------------

------------------------@1954-------------------------
Pack Testing
<p>Should we also be testing pack.cpp in player_tests.cpp since we're not pack tests? Or does the autograder only test buggy card and player implementations. Because I've written a lot of player tests and can't seem to get any more bugs.</p>

-------------------------------------------------
<div class="markdown" id="q38kRj58oo0ooY"><p>Your tests for <code>Pack</code> should go in <code>Pack_tests.cpp</code>. That’s why it was provided as a starter file. I can’t speak to what the autograder will test, but you shouldn’t put <code>Pack</code> tests in with <code>Player</code> tests, since that defeats the purpose of having separate files.</p></div>

Quesitons about deal_one
<p>My partner and I are confused on how to go about writing deal_one. We essentially just return cards[next++] but we get an out of bounds error. Using the debugger, it seems like next starts at 0, but if that's the case, we aren't sure why we get an out of bounds error. Could we get a little insight on how to start this function?</p>

-------------------------------------------------
<p>Make sure you initialize next in your Pack constructor. If it doesn't get explicitly initialized, it gets assigned some random value that won't work as an index.</p>

Segmentation fault when running operator test
Hello, I can't figure out what is causing a segmentation fault in my Operator< code.. at least I think that < is causing the problem because it's the only function I implemented with a loop. Logically, the code seems to make sense to me:
<br/>
- I assign a "weight" value (r_weight and s_weight for rank and suit) by iterating through the _NAMES_BY_WEIGHT arrays
<br/>
- When the get_rank() == array value at index "i" or "j" I would assign that value to the variable to get weight.
<br/>
- In the end, compare the weights of rhs and lhs.
<br/>
<br/>
I don't really see how/where I could be indexing out-of-bounds, which is what I thought that "segmentation fault" was
<br/>
<br/>
...
<br/>
    int lhs_r_weight = 0;
<br/>
    int rhs_r_weight = 0;
<br/>
    int lhs_s_weight = 0;
<br/>
    int rhs_s_weight = 0;
<br/>
<br/>
    for (int i = 0; i < NUM_RANKS; ++i) {
<br/>
        if (lhs.get_rank() == RANK_NAMES_BY_WEIGHT[i]) {
<br/>
            lhs_r_weight = i;
<br/>
        }
<br/>
        if (rhs.get_rank() == RANK_NAMES_BY_WEIGHT[i]) {
<br/>
            rhs_r_weight = i;
<br/>
        }
<br/>
    }
<br/>
    for (int j = 0; j < NUM_SUITS; ++j) {
<br/>
        if (lhs.get_suit() == SUIT_NAMES_BY_WEIGHT[j]) {
<br/>
            lhs_s_weight = j;
<br/>
        }
<br/>
        if (rhs.get_suit() == SUIT_NAMES_BY_WEIGHT[j]) {

Player Public test/Card constructor error
<p>I can't really tell what is going on and was wondering if I could get some guidance. When I run my Player public test, the card constructor runs twice, the first time it works, but the second time (which I don't know why it happens) just skips the lines of code and creates an empty card, so add card never works since there is an empty card. Could I get some guidance on this? Thanks.</p>

<p>Marking as resolved</p>

<div class="markdown" id="q38kRj58oo0ooY"><p>Are you instantiating a Card like this?</p>

<p>When I try running Player tests or the public tests, i keep getting repeated instances of this error. How do I fix this?</p>

-------------------------------------------------
<p>I can't tell exactly where this error is coming from, but if you are calling sort() in your make trump function in the human class, I would assume that's where the error is coming from. (Again not sure if you are doing sort() there but follow-up if you need more info on how to fix it)</p>


<p></p>


<p>Edit: for other students who may encounter this issue, swap() is a function that is used in the std::sort function, Normally this error comes from make_trump  in the Human class since make_trump is const, we can't change the private members of the class, so the usual workaround is to create a temporary vector, copy your hand of cards into this temporary vector, and sort/print this temporary vector instead. (This is only necessary for make_trump since it's the only function that is const)</p>

-------------------------------------------------
<p>I checked my sort functions and they’re written like how they are in the specs and there’s none in the make trump function, but I’m still having errors</p>


<p></p>

-------------------------------------------------
<p>In which functions are you using sort()?</p>

-------------------------------------------------
<p>Just the print hand function that I wrote in my human class.</p>

-------------------------------------------------
<p>And in which functions are you calling your print hand function?</p>

-------------------------------------------------
<p>make trump, add and discard, lead card, play card</p>

-------------------------------------------------
<p>Interesting, so technically if you are calling sort() in your printhand() function, and you are calling printhand() in your make_trump() function, you are basically sorting the hand within make_trump. The problem with this is that make_trump has const after it, meaning that we can't change our class member variables within this function. We also can't take off the const after the function declaration because it needs to match what is in the Player.h file. You can work around this issue by creating a temporary vector, then copy the cards from the hand vector into the temporary vector, then just sort and print the temporary vector.</p>


<p></p>


<p>Hope this helps!</p>

-------------------------------------------------
<p>Additionally, make sure you are declaring the copied hand inside of make_trump, do not declare it as a private member variable of HumanPlayer class like hand or you will get same error. Also do not use sort() in print_hand, you will get same error, just sort it before you call print_hand in the functions. </p>

pack issue
<p>Hello, our pack default constructor is failing the public test and we are unsure why. It is returning the first card as 2 of spades when it should be a 9 of spades. i attached the code for our default constructor as well as the deal_one code<img alt="Screen_Shot_2022-10-09_at_8.01.49_PM.png" src="/redirect/s3?bucket=uploads&amp;prefix=paste%2Fkp3dnvlkqrx2la%2Faa29355aaa98bfbdbbcdb54a34772ddc8c8bf3ae8af13817364cd3cb1187be52%2FScreen_Shot_2022-10-09_at_8.01.49_PM.png"/><img alt="Screen_Shot_2022-10-09_at_8.01.37_PM.pngNaN" src="/redirect/s3?bucket=uploads&amp;prefix=paste%2Fkp3dnvlkqrx2la%2Fe5ca64ab288c704c79bd01d542b7487395b57f1cb62fdbc6989fe38a542a8a36%2FScreen_Shot_2022-10-09_at_8.01.37_PM.png"/></p>

-------------------------------------------------
<p>I think the problem is that you are declaring an array of cards within this function when you do </p>


<p>Card cards[24], but you already have a cards array in the Pack.h class which is the one you want to fill.</p>

error with pack default constructor
<p>Hi, there is an error with our default constructor setting the first card to 2 of spades instead of 9 of spades. In summary, what we did was set next = 0 and then used a double for loop starting at the appropriate suit and rank to initialize the deck. Has anyone else had this issue, and how did you fix it??</p>

-------------------------------------------------
<div class="markdown" id="q38kRj58oo0ooY"><p>Is the error you’re talking about the “next variable is not used”? If so, then yes, setting the next variable to 0 is a good way to temporarily avoid this error when you compile.
Later when you use the next variable this error will go away.</p></div>

player.cpp assert undefined
<p>Hi, when I copied everything that the spec said I should copy for player.cpp into player.cpp, I got some red squiggly lines under the assert statements saying that assert is undefined. I did include all the #include statements listed from the spec.</p>


<p></p>


<p>I know there's been a previous post on this matter, but the solutions are marked as resolved so I don't know how to proceed. Thank you!</p>

-------------------------------------------------
<div class="markdown" id="q38kRj58oo0ooY"><p>If your IDE says that the <code>assert()</code> function is undefined, then you should add the <code>#include &lt;cassert&gt;</code> directive to the top of your <code>Player.cpp</code>.</p></div>

-------------------------------------------------
<div class="markdown" id="q38kRj58oo1ooY"><p>Something weird that happened to me was that the IDE would say that assert was undefined even with <code>#include &lt;cassert&gt;</code>. Weirdly enough, moving the <code>#include &lt;cassert&gt;</code> to the top of all the <code>include</code> statements worked (making it the first one). Don’t know if this is your issue but hope it helps.</p></div>

False positive on make_trump() tests in Player_tests
<p>My partner and I are confused on why this trump test is getting a false positive. It seems to make sense with the way making trump is described in the spec for the simple player strategy. Thanks!</p>


<p><img alt="Screen_Shot_2022-10-09_at_8.42.38_PM.pngNaN" src="/redirect/s3?bucket=uploads&amp;prefix=paste%2Fky330it8gsm70t%2F39dc25a1f0979df2ab3a9ab85cf571972c77abbf79ba8272d9b4d5cde5550449%2FScreen_Shot_2022-10-09_at_8.42.38_PM.png"/></p>

-------------------------------------------------
<p>It's possible this is a false positive because trump is uninitialized when passed in. </p>

-------------------------------------------------
<p>I'm still getting a false positive in autograder. To my understanding from the spec, since it's round 2 and the player is not the dealer, they should order up suit of spades because trump is clubs (and they have a spade in their hand, which is the opposite color of the upcard. Am I just not understanding the logic of the spec for making trump when it's round 2 and the player is not the dealer?</p>


<p><img alt="Screen_Shot_2022-10-10_at_6.45.38_PM.pngNaN" src="/redirect/s3?bucket=uploads&amp;prefix=paste%2Fky330it8gsm70t%2Fb1a0af907b0ce2ff367790c0309dc97504e8fb37d0dc27e1e8a4cbb8b6d46440%2FScreen_Shot_2022-10-10_at_6.45.38_PM.png"/></p>

-------------------------------------------------
<p>This is a false positive because they only call up spades if they have one or more face or ace cards. This means a King, Queen, Jack, or Ace of Spades. This also includes the left bower (Jack of Clubs). In your test case, you call it up on a nine of spades, which is not a face card.</p>

Implementing Sort function for Human
<p>Hello! I'm just wondering how I can implement a sort function from into my Human_Player derived class. Should I create a new operator overload function in my Human_Player derived class? Also, will the sort function change the vector &lt;Card&gt; hand?</p>

-------------------------------------------------
<div class="markdown" id="q38kRj58oo0ooY"><p>You can use the <code>sort()</code> function from the <code>&lt;algorithm&gt;</code> library, as described in <a href="https://eecs280staff.github.io/p3-euchre/#requirements-and-restrictions" rel="noreferrer" target="_blank">the spec</a>.</p>
<p>The third argument for <code>sort()</code> should be the operator you want to use for sorting. Pick one of the ones you wrote in <code>Card.cpp</code>.</p>
<p>You can read more and see examples in the documentation here: <a href="https://cplusplus.com/reference/algorithm/sort/" target="_blank">https://cplusplus.com/reference/algorithm/sort/</a></p></div>

<p></p>


<p>So something like this would work to sort my hand from least to greatest?</p>

-------------------------------------------------
<p>I think sort(hand.begin(), hand.end()); should suffice. Since you've already implemented a &lt; operator for cards, C++ knows to use this operator when sorting Card objects.</p>

<p>I'm getting this error whenever I call the sort function. Any ideas?</p>

Using assert() to check that RME is fulfilled

-------------------------------------------------
<div class="markdown" id="q38kRj58oo0ooY"><p>It is not required, since the RMEs are meant to never be violated. However it is good practice to add <code>assert()</code> statements, especially since they can be helpful while debugging.</p></div>

Issues with test_player_insertion
<p>My code seems to fail the first assertion test for test_player_insertion. In my code, the name is stored as NotRobot. However, when oss1 (the ostringstream) extracts this from the object, it seems to add on a "\n" to the end of the string, which causes me to fail the test.</p>


<p></p>


<p>This is an image of what is going on in my IDE. I basically copy pasted the code from the test case and ran the debugger. Just for reference, p is the pointer to the player object, s is the string extracted from p, and r is the correct string that is supposed to come out of it. For some reason, the variable s has an extra "\n" added to it after oss1.str() happens. Any help would be appreciated. Thank you!</p>


<p></p>


<p>P.S. My constructor for the Human and Simple class that both derive from Player simply have a string parameter that gets assigned to the name variable, so I do not think they are the root of the problem.</p>

<p>I have run all of these assertions and they all run correctly except the last one. I am unsure why the last assertion would not work given that all the others do. </p>

-------------------------------------------------
<p>If you think about it, get_rank() returns a string. Technically in your mind, you know which rank should be smaller, but the computer doesn't know what makes one string bigger than the other, so it can't really compare ranks for you.</p>

<p>I am not sure what went wrong with the implementation of the Player_factory since the debugger would stop when I tried to step through the Player public test case; TEST(test_simple_player_make_trump) at line 53 when I create new Player, Bob. I have implemented the Player_factory exactly as written in the spec and it is below the derived Player functions. </p>

<p>You shouldn't need to include Card.h in any of the files we're modifying. It is already in all the necessary header files. You probably added a header file where it wasn't needed.

<p>I would run suggest running your test cases on CAEN. I would assume it will fail there too, so try adding some print statements within your lead_card function and see where the values differ between what is printed on caen and what is printed on your computer from VScode</p>

-------------------------------------------------
<p>How did you end up fixing this? My partner and I are having the same issue and are unable to find the difference. </p>

-------------------------------------------------
<p>Did your tests pass on CAEN?</p>

-------------------------------------------------

------------------------@1977-------------------------
Line Length for Tests
<p>Does the rule of under 40 line functions apply to tests as well? Or can tests be more lines? Does the autograder test the test files for style?</p>

-------------------------------------------------
<p>I don't think we check style on test files, but I would run a style check on CAEN just to be 100% sure, the steps on how to do that are here: <a href="https://eecs280staff.github.io/p1-stats/setup_style.html" target="_blank">https://eecs280staff.github.io/p1-stats/setup_style.html</a></p>

order_up_suit and make_trump() testing
<p>I am confused about how to test if order_up_suit has (not) changed to the correct suit when make_trump() is run. I believe it is not possible to access order_up_suit from the testing file, is there a function that is in Player.h I could use to compare the actual string value of order_up_suit before and after make_trump() is run?</p>

-------------------------------------------------
<div class="markdown" id="q38kRj58oo0ooY"><p>Because <code>make_trump()</code> takes <code>std::string &amp;order_up_suit</code> as a reference variable, the function will change the actual value of the string passed into <code>make_trump()</code>.</p>
<p>You can see the <code>Player_public_test.cpp</code> file’s <code>test_simple_player_make_trump</code> for an example.</p></div>

-------------------------------------------------
<p>I would remove this followup and make a private post because it is against the honor code. However, make sure you are declaring the copied hand inside of make_trump, do not declare it as a private member variable of HumanPlayer class or you will get same error. Also do not use sort() in print_hand, you will get same error, just sort it before you call print_hand in the functions. </p>

Lead card and play card are working but not working

Player factory errors

-------------------------------------------------
<p>Any constructor you write yourself with parameters that you pass in would be a non-default constructor. If you have constructors it might be that your syntax is off when you call it and it might be causing errors. If you need more help post a screenshot of the error</p>

<blockquote>
<p><strong>Q: Why am I getting a compiler error for calling sort?</strong><br/>
Note that the sort function modifies the hand. You cannot modify member variables in a const function, so you’ll receive a compiler error if you call sort in a const member function.<br/></p>

-------------------------------------------------
<p>Another approach you can take to ensuring your hand is sorted in make_trump is calling sort on your hand each time that you modify the hand in other non-const functions. For example, if you sort each time you either add or remove a card from your hand, you will know that the hand is sorted at all times.</p>

Shuffle
<p>I'm having a problem within shuffle when its supposed to be putting the top card of the bottom half in index 0 (should be Card Nine of Clubs) but instead it is inputting Nine of Diamonds. I found this is because in placing the first half of the deck in every other, it skips the king and ace of all of the suits. I'm confused as to what is causing this.</p>


<p></p>


<p>Here is my shuffle() for reference</p>


<p><a href="/redirect/s3?bucket=uploads&amp;prefix=paste%2Fl7caz44o3c76oc%2F3b19c420c272a6b7552e1928fc3491e2e6380c3a111ec57fd9d4cb838dfcd11c%2Fshuffle.png" rel="noreferrer" target="_blank">shuffle.png</a></p>

-------------------------------------------------
<p>Glancing through your shuffle function, the logic appears to be right. However, I would recommend putting breakpoints in the pack_public_test and then in the outer for loop of the shuffle function, and see what the array looks like through each iteration.  If needed you can also put break points in the inner for loop as well. </p>

false positive for add_discard for simple players
<p>Hi,</p>


<p>my uniquename is angelalz. after I turned in Autotrader, my add_discard tests are shown to be having false positive cases. I tried the debugger and can't find where this error could come from. I am wondering whether this is an edge case error or if i am understanding the spec incorrectly. Could anyone please help take a look at my test and my code for add_discard and give me some clues on how to solve this?</p>

-------------------------------------------------
<p>Your add_discard test is a false positive, meaning it failed when run on a correct implementation of SimplePlayer. It looks like your assertion ASSERT_EQUAL(cardPlayed2, KS) is where the test failed: The correct solution played King of Clubs, but your test expects a King of Spades. I would review the game rules in the spec to see why your test shouldn't expect a King of Spades here. Hope this helps!</p>

<p>It looks like you've implemented some member functions in SimplePlayer (like the constructor and get_name()), but not all of them (add_card(), make_trump(), etc.).

<p>Are we allowed/should we be using Pack in the Player classes for the derived functions to work? For the add_card (for example) would we need a Pack to represent the Player's Hand(?)</p>

-------------------------------------------------
<p>If I am correct, you shouldn't call any constructors/functions from pack inside of player.cpp. You will call pack functions/constructors in euchre.cpp. In order to represent the player's hand, I would advise creating a private member variable inside of the player subclasses that is a vector.  Then you should be able to figure out how to add cards to that vector inside of your add_card function. You can also represent hand as an array, but it will be harder to add and remove cards from it. </p>

<p>Hi I checked my codes for several times but I did not get why it failed the public test where the correct answer should be king_club but mine outputs 2_spade. Is there anyone who can give me a hint? Or is it possible that my codes are wrong somewhere else? Thanks.</p>

-------------------------------------------------
<p>I'd recommend setting breakpoints in the pack_public_test, because this will allow you to visualize what the pack looks like through each iteration of shuffle. You could start by looking at how the pack looks after the each shuffle, and if needed put a break point in the inner for loops. If the pack seems to be fine after 7 shuffles, I'd set a break point for the deal one function, because maybe there could be an error there.</p>

Autograder doesn't run, but terminal did
<p>We are getting this error when submitting to autograder, yet, when we run our terminal all the tests pass. I attached an image of our autograder below and was wondering what the solution was to fix this. Thanks!<img alt="Screen_Shot_2022-10-10_at_8.56.16_AM.pngNaN" src="/redirect/s3?bucket=uploads&amp;prefix=paste%2Fkthuyfeq1of768%2F32d916ec381ec62506fa829381657723702d72a6adb9a6bb5d4e7e0c980f13ef%2FScreen_Shot_2022-10-10_at_8.56.16_AM.png"/></p>

-------------------------------------------------
<p>It looks like your iterator is going out of bounds. The tests on your computer aren't necessarily the same as the autograder, so passing them locally doesn't mean you implemented the functions correctly, it just means your functions happen to work for the data set you gave it. Here's something that might help you fix the bug.</p>


<p></p>


<p>https://stackoverflow.com/questions/62710870/is-clamping-on-iterators-valid</p>

-------------------------------------------------
<p>Thanks! Because it's one of the public tests shouldn't it be the same though? Also I realized I had the lead_card for the human set to assert(false). Would that affect the autograder and just make it fail, even though its testing simple. </p>

-------------------------------------------------
<p>Sorry, for the public tests, the actual tests may be the same, but the data for the tests might be different (its like the parameters for a function, you could pass x=2 and I could pass x=10 -- doesn't change the function, but the behavior might change. Just work on finding that error and you should be good. And no, human is not being tested on autograder (I set them all to assert false)</p>

-------------------------------------------------
<p>Your syntax for this function appears to be correct, so I think the problem is coming from somewhere else. Have you included the correct headers at the top of the file? Sometimes, it can also be a syntax error from a function written above, where it can't recognize something afterwards because of that. Otherwise, I would recommend running player_tests or player_public_tests and seeing what the compile error messages are because they could be more insightful.</p>

<p>Pack.h is not needed for Player.cpp and you should not #include it in that file.</p>

<p>i tried that and it didnt work. I've also run it on caen and it works, but not autograder</p>

-------------------------------------------------
<p>The autograder is not giving you the Pack.h file because it is unnecessary for Player.cpp. You can run it on CAEN because you provide it Pack.h. What do you mean by it doesn't work when your remove "#include "Pack.h"?</p>

<p>i meant on caen, i ran it and it worked. so if i submit to autograder again, should that error be removed?</p>

Question about std::string Card:: get_suit(const std::string &trump) const
<div>
<div>For the std::string Card:: get_suit(const std::string &amp;trump) const function, are we supposed to check what suit the trump is and set it to the opposite suit of same color and return that suit? I keep getting errors with this function when setting suit equal to a string. Any strategies on approaching this would be very helpful.</div>
</div>


<p></p>

-------------------------------------------------
<p>There are two get_suit functions, the first should just return the suit of the card. The second takes in the parameter trump, and returns the suit as well (we need trump to check for bowers). The second function's only purpose it to be able to make sure the left bower is considered the same suit as trump</p>

-------------------------------------------------
<p>After finding the suit of the left bower, I'm confused on how we make sure the left bower is considered the same suit of the trump?</p>

-------------------------------------------------
<div class="markdown" id="q38kRj58oo0ooY"><p>The <code>get_suit()</code> function gets the suit of the card that it was assigned at initialization. The <code>get_suit(trump)</code> does the same thing, but with the sole exception that this function will consider the jack of the next suit of the trump to be trump. i.e., if this function is called on the Jack of Clubs and the trump suit is Spades, the function will return spades.</p></div>

player testing
<p>I am unsure as to how I am supposed to run tests with the player class's add_card if I am not able to see the player's hand outside of its class implementation.</p>

-------------------------------------------------
<p>You can't see the player's whole hand, but you can see cards in the players hand one at a time. When you lead or play a card, that card comes from the player's hand. So, you should test what gets added to a player's hand by understanding that playing a card or leading a card has an expected card output.</p>

Deleting card from hand
<p>How can I delete a card from the array hand. I understand you can use erase if hand was a vector but in my Class, hand is an array. Is it possible to remove a specific indexed element from the array?</p>

-------------------------------------------------
<p>Yes it's possible, it just way more of a hassle than using vectors. You'll have to keep track of the size of the array, and basically shift each element left once you remove one. There's a couple ways to do it, I'll leave a link below.</p>


<p></p>


<p><a href="https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/delete-an-element-from-array-using-two-traversals-and-one-traversal/" rel="noreferrer" target="_blank">https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/delete-an-element-from-array-using-two-traversals-and-one-traversal/</a></p>


<p></p>


<p>*This honestly might take you longer than just switching from an array to a vector in your code, but up to you</p>

-------------------------------------------------
<div class="markdown" id="q38kRj58oo0ooY"><p>I would recommend switching your hand to be represented as a vector. As the student answer states, you can “remove” cards from an array, but this tends to be a lot trickier to keep track of. Using a vector should help you implicitly avoid some of the errors that might come with using an array.</p></div>

Attempt to erase from container error
<p>Hello! My roommate and I have this undefined behavior showing up and we are unsure what it means.

-------------------------------------------------
<p>It’s likely that you are passing an out of bounds index to the <code>erase()</code> function. Remember that the hand is not always of size 5, and make sure your index that you pass in is smaller than the size of the vector.</p>


<p></p>


<p>Tip: It's much easier to create an iterator for the card you're wanting to delete like such</p>


<p><code>auto card = (something)</code></p>


<p>and then you can just call</p>


<p><code>hand.erase(card);</code><code></code></p>


<p>Then you don't have to worry about bounds, assuming you get the iterator correct.<code></code></p>

-------------------------------------------------
<p>Could you specify what you mean by an iterator? Just slightly confused what "auto card = (something)" means. Thanks!</p>

-------------------------------------------------
<div class="markdown" id="q38kRj58oo0ooY"><p>When you use a <code>vector</code>’s erase function, the syntax is:</p>
<pre><code>vector_name.erase(vector_name.begin() + index);
</code></pre><p>To be honest I don’t know the guts of how it works and what an iterator technically is but we abstract that away for now. I think that the student answer means to have you store the index/iterator of the card (<code>vector_name.begin() + index</code>) in that variable and then use it.</p></div>

-------------------------------------------------
<p>To tack on, for reference in c++ auto lets the compiler figure out what the variable type is.</p>

-------------------------------------------------
<div class="markdown" id="q38kRj58oo0ooY"><p>From taking a quick look at your code on the autograder, I would guess there could be an issue with your <code>highest_card</code> variable in <code>lead_card</code>. Consider if there are any cases that this variable might not actually be set to a card in the hand before being used. I would also double check the bounds of your for loops. Is there any case where the player does not have a full hand and iterating through <code>MAX_HAND_SIZE</code> would be problematic?</p></div>

Play_card scenario for Simple Player
<p>If the trump suit is Spades and the Led suit is Diamonds, and the simple player has a hand consisting of a Jack of Spades(right bower) and Ace of Diamonds, would the simple player play ace of diamonds first because according to the specification, "Simple Players use a simple strategy that considers only the suit that was led"?</p>

-------------------------------------------------
<p>A simple player plays the highest card that follows suit if they can, lowest card otherwise. In this case, the player would play the Ace. Playing the right bower would be invalid since you're not following suit.</p>

-------------------------------------------------
<p>marking as resolved</p>

-------------------------------------------------
<p>But just to clarify, the Card_less function cannot be used here to determine order because it considers trump before it considers led suit correct? so the Card_less function would output Jack of Spades instead right</p>

<p>I'm going to take a guess that your issue is in the deal_one() function. Do you use prefix or postfix notation when you increment next? Because that can change what you return...</p>

-------------------------------------------------
<p>postfix, but I save the initial value of 'next' in a separate variable, increment next, then use the separate variable to return the card at the index.</p>

-------------------------------------------------
<p>Is it possible this is a problem with istream and not the regular cstor? Assuming you implemented the Pack array correctly in the constructor, I'm lost as to how you could ever reach 24. You do have a loop in the istream cstor, so I wouldn't be surprised if that's where your error came in</p>


<p></p>


<p></p>

-------------------------------------------------
<p>Yes</p>

-------------------------------------------------
<p>See above, removed code</p>

-------------------------------------------------
<p>I'm more convinced that it has to do with the regular ctor, because the error specifically said</p>


<pre>Running test: test_pack_default_ctor</pre>
<p>I do use for loops to iterate through the suit and rank arrays, starting from the index that I would need for euchre, but I'm confused as to why the autograder thinks I'm going out of bounds when the compiler isn't saying anything about it. </p>

-------------------------------------------------
<p>Without seeing your code, I'm not sure what else it could be. Given that your deal_one function is more than likely correct, I'm guessing it would have to be something with that constructor. You set next to 0, so it can't be that -- so its gotta be the card array then. We're told the cards are in the same order as pack.in, so the deck should be initialized to starting with 9 of spades..Hearts, Clubs, Diamonds.</p>


<p></p>


<p>The proper way to initialize an array in a constructor with multiple items is to do this:</p>


<p></p>


<p>arrayName( {item1, item2, item3} )</p>


<p></p>


<p>Adjust this to work with cards and that might solve your issue.</p>


<p></p>


<p>If you already did that, I've got no idea what it could be. Sorry! Best bet would be to go to office hours.</p>

-------------------------------------------------
<p>Ah, I'll try that then. Thanks for all the help!</p>

-------------------------------------------------
<p>Let me know if it works!</p>

-------------------------------------------------
<p>That fixed it! Thanks so much</p>

<p>Edit: To add on to what Wayne said, you might be trying to call sort using a custom comparison operator. If you are trying to use Card_less, it will not work because Card_less isn't a compare operator. that type of function only takes two inputs and returns a bool; Card_less takes three inputs and returns a bool. </p>

No matching function to call swap error
<p>I keep getting this error message and I have no idea how to fix.</p>

<p></p>

-------------------------------------------------
<p>This is likely because you are calling sort in a const function. Remember that sort modifies private member variables, and thus violates the promise made by a const modifier.</p>

-------------------------------------------------
<p>So, the provided print hand function uses the hand private vector; if we can't sort the hand, the how do we call print hand on a temp hand we created?</p>

-------------------------------------------------
<div class="markdown" id="q38kRj58oo0ooY"><p><code>print_hand</code> is not defined in the <code>.h</code> file, so you can change its function signature - you can just remove the <code>const</code> at the end of the function if you want to sort the hand in the <code>print_hand</code> function or you can make a separate function to enforce this invariant and call it at the end of every non-<code>const</code> function.</p></div>

using card less (with trump) in card less (with trump and led card)
<p>This might be a dumb question. But is it possible to use card less trump inside the card less trump-led function? I was thinking that adding some extra line to check for the led suit might work but also doubting that the ranking will be different when a led card is present and it might not work?</p>


<p></p>


<p>That brings another concern to my mind that the last card_less function will be double or more the size of the first card_less function.. is that ideal? </p>

-------------------------------------------------
<p>For the card_less function that considered the led card, you can and should use the card_less function that only considered the two cards and trump, just make sure you don't accidentally call the card_less function with the led card, otherwise you'll be looping for quite awhile. In terms of size, they're both actually quite similar.</p>

Getting false negative
<p>I'm getting a false negative for one of my test cases testing the lead_card function.</p>


<p></p>


<p>To explain the logic behind it, I am testing a case in which a simple player has all trump cards, including both bowers. </p>


<p></p>


<p>where diamonds is trump, </p>


<p></p>


<p>-jack of diamonds</p>


<p>-jack of hearts</p>


<p>-king of diamonds</p>


<p>-queen of diamonds</p>


<p>-ten of diamonds</p>


<p></p>


<p>I call lead_card 5 times in a row, which would end up exhausting the entire hand in this order: jack of diamonds -&gt; jack of hearts (left bower) -&gt; king of diamonds -&gt; queen of diamonds -&gt; ten of diamonds, </p>


<p></p>


<p>following the logic that the simple player leads the trick by choosing the highest valued card IF their hand only has trump cards, such as this specific case. But autograder has been saying that a correct implementation was failing this test. </p>


<p></p>


<p>(I will post this as instructors only in the case that I may be sharing test cases)</p>

-------------------------------------------------
<p>It's tough to tell what the problem is if your logic for the test cases is correct. I would recommend printing the cards you are returning from lead_card() and making sure they match exactly the card you are trying to compare it to. I would also recommend running on CAEN too just to make sure the results of the test case are consistent.</p>


<p></p>


<p>If you still can't figure it out, try to split the test case into 5 seperate test cases and see which one is causing the false positive.</p>

Can left bower be considered as lead suit?
<p>I'm a bit confused about whether the left bower is still considered a part of its original suit or not. After reading questions <a data-pats="post_ref" href="1913" onclick="return PE.gotoPost('1913');">@1913</a> and <a data-pats="post_ref" href="1878" onclick="return PE.gotoPost('1878');">@1878</a>, I'm unsure if you can play the left bower if there are no cards of the lead suit.</p>

-------------------------------------------------
The left bower is no longer considered the original suit, instead it is considered the trump suit. If the trump is spades, the jack of clubs is taken as a spade.
<div>If there are no cards of the lead suit, a Simple player strategy requires you to choose the lowest card you have. If that is a left bower, then you can play it. As a Human player too, you have the liberty to play the same as long as you don't have any cards of the lead suit. </div>

Player.cpp Test Cases
<p>Right now on the autograder, it says I still need to expose 2 more bugs for the Player.cpp class. I have been trying to add more and more test cases, but I have not been able to expose any more bugs. I've been stuck at 15/17. Would it be possible to give me any indication or tips on the areas I should focus on for my test cases? I sent a picture of the names of the test cases that I currently have.</p>

-------------------------------------------------
<p>Since you've already written so many tests its tough to tell what the last 2 bugs are. At this point, I don't recommend you write any more test cases. I recommend you start writing euchre.cpp, when you start debugging euchre.cpp you will notice some bugs arise and you can probably add more tests that would expose your bugs to your tests as you go later.</p>

Does Pack::cards take in a string or the actual values?
<p>Does it take in a string like "Three of Spades" or does it take in RANK_THREE and SUIT_SPADES?</p>

-------------------------------------------------
<p>If you're referring to the Pack from istream, the array is of type Card, so you have to turn the values(rank and suit) into a card, and add those cards to to cards array in Pack</p>

<p>For Pack::Pack(std::istream&amp; pack_input), are we supposed to read in each line as a string into the array?</p>

SimplePlayer lead card and play card seg faults
<p>Whenever I try to run the public test for player I get a segmentation fault for lead card and play card. I tried fixing lead card but it still returns a seg fault. Could you lead me on the right track for what I need to fix?</p>


<p><a href="/redirect/s3?bucket=uploads&amp;prefix=paste%2Fkswmvh3nmaebm%2F3b4b8ac8a0308ec5c6c59dfe190e4534ad3f22bbbef03fa1de8bafaf35fed159%2FPlayer.cpp" rel="noreferrer" target="_blank">Player.cpp</a></p>

-------------------------------------------------
<p>It looks like you're iterating from 0 to MAX_HAND_SIZE in your for loops of SimplePlayer::lead_card(). Remember that there won't always be MAX_HAND_SIZE cards in the player's hand. After at least 1 trick is played, there will be fewer than MAX_HAND_SIZE cards.</p>


<p></p>


<p>One other thing I'm noticing is that your lead_card() function counts the number of trump cards by comparing trump to Card::get_suit(). What if you encounter the Left Bower? Card::get_suit() would return the next suit instead of trump. To fix this, make sure you use Card::get_suit(trump).</p>

calling get_suit on led_card

play_card question
<p>If the trump suit and the led suit are the same, and we call the function play card, is the Left Bower considered to be following suit?</p>

-------------------------------------------------
Yes, the left bower is considered to be the trump suit in any circumstance.

-------------------------------------------------
<p>Also, if you were to pass in the Left Bower as the led card, would following suit mean a card with the same suit as the Left Bower or the same suit as the trump card?</p>

-------------------------------------------------
<div class="markdown" id="q38kRj58oo0ooY"><p>Same suit as trump.</p></div>

------------------------@2040-------------------------
calling sort in a const function
<p>If the provided print hand function uses the hand private vector in player.cpp and we can't sort the hand, then how do we call print hand on a temp hand we created?</p>

-------------------------------------------------
<p>What do you mean by temp hand? The only way to access private variables of a class is with a private member function. Your print function should be declared in HumanPlayer, not Player. Then it will have access to the vector to print it. When you go to define your print function, you'll then do something like</p>


<p></p>


<p>void HumanPlayer::print_hand() const {}</p>

-------------------------------------------------
<div class="markdown" id="q38kRj58oo0ooY"><p>You can change the signature of <code>print_hand()</code> to be non-<code>const</code>, and thus you can sort the hand in <code>print_hand</code>. I would avoid making a separate hand as it would make things more complicated and you may run into more bugs.</p></div>

-------------------------------------------------
<p>Does this mean we can remove const from the make_trump function as well?</p>

-------------------------------------------------
<p>No, that function is declared as const and should be const. The print_hand function is a function you made, and you can declare it as whatever you want. As said above, making another hand is more difficult, so the best way to do this is just to make a regular function without const so that the function has the ability to modify hand. We declare functions as const when we don't want them to modify attributes of the class. We want the hand to be sorted, so it's fine declaring it without const. For functions that are already declared const in the given project files, do not modify their signatures.</p>

-------------------------------------------------
<p>but if you declare print_hand to be not const, then you can't use print_hand in a const func right? Then how should you use it in make_trump function?</p>

-------------------------------------------------
Good question - you could make a separate helper function to print the hand in the `make_trump` function or you could make the hand being sorted a data invariant - every time you change the hand you sort it right after (since those functions are already non-const). In the latter, you can actually keep print_hand as const.

add and discard card in make_trump
<p>This is a clarifying question: in the make_trump function, should we also invoke add and discard for the given trump card if the player is a dealer or is that done in euchre.cpp? Remind me if it was mentioned anywhere in the specification, thanks!</p>

-------------------------------------------------
<p>You can't call it since make_trump uses a constant player, so you can't modify player in anyway. (Assuming add_and_discard changes some hand member variable)</p>


<p>So implement in the driver (euchre.cpp)</p>

False positives in player_tests
<p>For many of our player tests, we are getting false positives in autograder. I have an extensive set of tests where I used all the same logic for my assert statements. I would think that even if my Player.cpp was wrong, the logic for the tests would still be correct, and it would then be telling me I'm failing my tests. But my tests are passing as well. It seems like I might be missing something big. Would any instructor be able to look at my tests in autograder to see if there's a logic mistake I'm making throughout?</p>


<p></p>


<p>Thanks!</p>

-------------------------------------------------
<p>For the add_card_play_card tests, it's tough to tell why it's causing a false positive because your logic looks fine. I would recommend running on CAEN and seeing if the tests still pass. It's definitely possible that your tests will pass there too, so try to print the value of the cards you are passing into ASSERT and double-check that the values are exactly the same. </p>

Add_and_discard lowest card question

Issue about helper function get_hand()
<p>I declared "get_hand()" inside the player.h file as a virtual function (as shown below).</p>


<p><img alt="image.png" src="/redirect/s3?bucket=uploads&amp;prefix=paste%2Fl7d9tlrulks4nu%2F80869dd80ddc58f92692b880265d6b85e78cded710dc9c1a992f9a01c84fcef4%2Fimage.png"/></p>


<p></p>


<p>I then implement the get_hand() function inside the class simple_player (as shown below)</p>


<p><img alt="image.png" src="/redirect/s3?bucket=uploads&amp;prefix=paste%2Fl7d9tlrulks4nu%2Faa46709bf0bf4bad442432d6356f6767e72a3859143b6467e98931926b080262%2Fimage.png"/></p>


<p></p>


<p>I passes all the tests (both public and private tests) locally and there is no issue compiling and running the code. But the autograder does not like this helper function and gives the following error message:</p>


<p><img alt="image.png" src="/redirect/s3?bucket=uploads&amp;prefix=paste%2Fl7d9tlrulks4nu%2F76c90b93e2ca719e20ceac4b0ddf4072250faf241cfa14ae63a645b90ed44bd6%2Fimage.png"/></p>


<p>I was wondering how I could fix this issue. Thank you.</p>

-------------------------------------------------
<p>I believe someone else had this issue as well. The static keyword will give the function internal linkage and get rid of that error. So just put static in front of that function</p>

-------------------------------------------------
<p>From the spec, you shouldn't be modifying the .h file, but if you want a helper function, it should be a <em>non-member function</em> and declared as static.</p>


<p></p>


<p>As stated in the follow-up, making it a non-member function would make the private member hand inaccessible. Do you really need to have this function available though, if all it does is return the player's hand (I'm guessing)? You can just directly reference the hand variable.</p>

-------------------------------------------------
<p>I also attempted to mark the helper function as static, but seems to be me a compiler error when I return hand from it. ( I believe it has something do to with static)</p>

-------------------------------------------------
<p>Also, I know that I am not allowed to put this function inside .h file, but if I don't, I can't create a player A and use the function A-&gt;get_hand() in my test cases because there is no get_hand() function inside player class.</p>

-------------------------------------------------
<p>If declared outside of the simpleplayer class, hand becomes inaccessible as it is a private variable.</p>

-------------------------------------------------
<p>See below; unfortunately, you cannot use get_hand() in your test cases. For a hint, look toward the functions that return cards and see how you can use them to validate that the function you called previously performed correctly.</p>

-------------------------------------------------
<p>I see. I mainly want to use this function in the tests to make sure the hands are correct after applying the function. Perhaps there might be a better way to do so?</p>

-------------------------------------------------
<p>You'll have to stick with the interface given for your tests as when they run them against different code your private functions won't exist.</p>

Bus error
<p>What does this mean?  Test_simple_play_card1 is testing for when a player has all trump cards and a trump which player doesn't have was led. They should be playing the highest card in their hand but I am getting a bus error.</p>


<p><img alt="" height="156" src="/redirect/s3?bucket=uploads&amp;prefix=paste%2Fksxikn2v41x5ja%2F2c6fd2b023e33916bd5146a8bde7450bc56b44825f6f1160bed0a4c89540cdaa%2FScreen_Shot_2022-10-10_at_5.00.01_PM.png" width="308"/></p>

-------------------------------------------------
<p>A bus error is extremely uncommon, first of all. While seg faults can occur from trying to access memory outside your process(things like pointing to things that are deallocated, using a nullptr, overflowing a buffer) bus errors occur when your processor literally can't even attempt the memory access requested (not a valid address).</p>


<p></p>


<p>As for how to fix it, double check things like bounds, memory allocation and deallocation</p>

including cpp files
<p>Are we allowed to include cpp files in other cpp files. For example, I want to use a static helper function from Card.cpp in Pack.cpp to make the empty() function easier, but I'm not sure if that is allowed.</p>

-------------------------------------------------
<p>No, you should never include .cpp files in other .cpp files as it leads to compilation issues. That's why header files (.h) exists. Unfortunately, since we aren't allowed to modify the header files, we don't have a way of accessing that function :(</p>


<p>If it's possible, you would just have to redefine the function in Pack.cpp</p>

Segfault with code
<p>Getting a segmentation fault with our code in lead_card, it seems to be the first and third if statement, but unsure if we're going out of bounds and if thats the case, where in our code is it going out of bounds<img alt="Screen_Shot_2022-10-10_at_5.35.12_PM.png" height="474" src="/redirect/s3?bucket=uploads&amp;prefix=paste%2Fktt6mnkjjgv19w%2F3cd702a85f599c806c46fde31c734f69c7c7e8b8d696237e7a250f2904a83f21%2FScreen_Shot_2022-10-10_at_5.35.12_PM.png" width="647"/></p>

-------------------------------------------------
<p>It's hard to tell without being able to see what's around it, but I don't think the second for loop does what you think it does. Try stepping through and seeing if the variables in the IDE agree with what you think they should be. More specifically, check out what happens immediately after you call temp.erase().</p>


<p></p>


<p>From what I see here, I don't think your segmentation fault is happening because of any of this, though.</p>

Pack istream
<p>How would I read in the strings from the input stream? Right now I have a while loop but it's giving me a segmentation error and it seems like I'm not correctly reading in the rank, "of" and suit separately. </p>

-------------------------------------------------
<p>What are the parameters of your while loop first of all? You have a PACK_SIZE variable, so you should definitely be utilizing that. The strings are conveniently separated by spaces, so like in our image project, you can just use the &gt;&gt; operator to grab the words. You mentioned having trouble reading them separately, more than likely because of that word "of" in there. You have 2 options:</p>


<p></p>


<p>1.) Read in all the words on the line, with a garbage string for "of"</p>


<p></p>


<p>2.) istream has a function .ignore(count), where count is the number of characters to ignore. Maybe you could utilize that...</p>

-------------------------------------------------
<p>I decided to change to a for loop until i &lt; PACK_SIZE, with 3 std::string variables rank, garbage, and suit. Would I be able to just read each word separately using these 3 varibles (becuase of the convenient spacing) and then create a card (a), and add it to the "cards" array by using cards.push_back(a)?</p>

-------------------------------------------------
<p>You got it! Just remember there's no push_back for arrays, that's for vectors. You have to put each card in at some index</p>

<p>thank you so much!</p>

Player Factory private tests
<p>Hi!</p>


<p>Everything is passing in our auto grader, we are just missing a few player private tests. I wonder if it is possible/if it even makes sense to test player_factory by itself as I don´t know how I would approach it. I am using it in every other private test. Is this sufficient? If not, does anyone have a hint on how I could test player_factory?<br/><br/>Thank you :)</p>

<p>You don't need to test the factory. Your tests should just focus on the functions implemented in SimplePlayer</p>

lead card meaning
<p>I want to clarify the meaning of the lead card. The specs and the piazza post contradict each other when it says to play the lowest non trump card or the highest non trump card. Which is correct?<br/><br/>If a player has all spades in his hand and the trump suit is diamonds, would the player lead in with Ace of Spades or Nine of Spades?</p>


<p></p>

<p>There are two situations here, neither result in the simple player playing their lowest card, trump or not.</p>

<p>Situation one: Simple player has all trump -&gt; Play the highest one trump</p>


<p>Situation two: Simple player does not have all trump (either no trump or at least one trump) -&gt; Play the highest card that is not trump (note that highest also has to do with suit, eg diamonds are higher than spades)</p>

Tests with false positives:
<p>I write some correct tests and my code past all of them. However, the autograder gives me errors back like this for one unit test. What does that mean?</p>

-------------------------------------------------
<p>It means that the test case that you wrote ran on a completely correct implementation, but the test case still failed. This implies that there is something wrong with your assert statements in the test case (it has nothing to do with your player.cpp, card.cpp, etc.). Check the logic that you are asserting in that particular test case and ensure that it follows the euchre rules.</p>

sort
<p>If sort is sorting the hand in the wrong order, which functions are the errors to debug?</p>

-------------------------------------------------
<p>std::sort uses the less than operator (&lt;) to compare cards, so your issue is most likely there. Remember, though, that operator&lt; shouldn't consider either trump or the led card, only suit (doesn't care about Left Bower) and rank.</p>

-------------------------------------------------
<p>How can I get it to consider trump and led suit then? Because the sort using a function only accepts functions with exactly 2 inputs, unlike our Card_less function.</p>

-------------------------------------------------
<p>You shouldn't need to use Card_less with any instance of std::sort. You said sorting is resulted in incorrect order. Go back and see if it is actually not sorted properly, remembering that it shouldn't consider trump or a led card.</p>

Is it safe to assume that there will be no impossible hands?
<p>Like the question says. Does our test need to deal with impossible hands? For example, having two of the same cards, or two identical cards, one in hand and the other as a lead card or upcard.</p>

-------------------------------------------------
<p>It doesn't hurt to test for those hands as the RMEs of the functions don't explicitly state the hands need to be valid. </p>

-------------------------------------------------
As the student mentioned, the only assumptions about input you can make are based on the RMEs. So when it comes to how players operate in different situations you should test on any edge cases you think are relavent or could arise if a, let's say, other developer tries to use your player implementations, card implementation, or pack implementations.

-------------------------------------------------

------------------------@2069-------------------------
in play card
<p>what if the lead card and the trump are the same? do you return the highest trump card?</p>

-------------------------------------------------
<p>Per the spec:</p>


<blockquote>
<p>If a Simple Player can follow suit, they play the highest card that follows suit. Otherwise, they play the lowest card in their hand.</p>
</blockquote>


<p><br/>So, you would play the highest card that is the same suit of the led card. If the trump suit is the same suit, then you play your highest card which would be the highest trump card.</p>

-------------------------------------------------
<p>Follow up on that: </p>


<p></p>


<p>if my lead_card is HEARTS, and trump is also HEARTS, is the highest card that follows suit ACE_HEARTS or JACK_HEARTS (simple player)?</p>


<p>I believe that it is the first, since simple player doesn´t consider trump suits. I am asking because ever since I added this private test case, I am getting false positive error feedback. </p>

-------------------------------------------------
<p>Jack of Hearts is the highest card. The simple player does consider trump suit when playing. </p>

Initially, I thought that's what 'next' is going to be used for. But when I read posts about deal_one, it seems I have to use 'next' for the dealing functions. or do I use it for both purposes? I am confused now.</p>


<p></p>


<p>Edit: I changed my code so that I am using a new variable for creating the Pack, so leaving alone the Next variable to be used for deal_one.. but where do I set the initial value of the next variable? If I set it within the Pack function, then the compiler says next is an unused variable. Any help would be appreicated.</p>

-------------------------------------------------
<p>I'm dumb not gonna lie. I was doing int next and creating a new next variable in my function and that's why I was being told by the compiler that next is unused. Sorry if anyone got confused by my question.</p>

-------------------------------------------------
<p>Mark as resolved. It is typical for students trying to make new local variables instead of using the "same" member variables when you just get started with C++ style classes. This is a good reminder though -- always check member variables and find out how to use them!</p>

Pack.cpp deal_one
<p>Hi :)<br/><br/>We are suddenly running into issues with the pack deal_one function. My partner coded it and submitted the code on Autograder, where the file was accepted. (Best submission for checkpoint). However, when I submitted it later tonight, I am suddenly getting the error that I am going out of bounds. Can someone help me to look over it, please? I really appreciate your help!!<br/><br/>Best,</p>

-------------------------------------------------
<p>From your implementation of deal_one(), an out of bounds error could happen if the value of "next" is a bad value. Have you looked at the value of "next" for this test case and checked that it is not out of bounds? It could also be that the cards array is not set up correctly so I would also look there and make sure it contains what you expect it to. </p>

Code duplication style
<p>Hello. In my player.cpp I implement my own helper function that has the exact same implementation in the human and simple player classes. This fails on the style guide and says there is code duplication. How should I solve this problem since I can't add the function the the player.h file (which is what I think would solve this problem)?</p>

-------------------------------------------------
<p>You could create the function outside of the classes, and pass in a player* object to the function.</p>

-------------------------------------------------
<p>Alternatively, if the helper function performs some task like "find the card from this vector according to X criteria", you might restructure it so that it's a non-member function that doesn't know about "players" at all and just operates on the collection of cards.</p>

-------------------------------------------------
<p>wouldn't I still have to declare this function in the header file though? Or can I just define it in the .cpp </p>

-------------------------------------------------
<p>You can just define it in the .cpp as a free static function</p>

player function not accounting for trump.
<p>For add_and_discard, I am unsure how to account for trump. I am just using the &lt; operator, which follows the generic ranking system. I was thinking to use Card_less, but I cannot implement it correctly. Not sure if that is the right idea.</p>

-------------------------------------------------
<div class="markdown" id="q38kRj58oo0ooY"><p>Yes, you should be using <code>Card_less</code> to compare with the context of the game. It should be used in a similar manner to the <code>&lt;</code> operator:</p>

Pack_tests
<p>How extensively should we test pack outside of the public tests?</p>

-------------------------------------------------
<div class="markdown" id="q38kRj58oo0ooY"><p>As extensively as you think you’ll need. Remember that the purpose of tests is to catch bugs that you wouldn’t normally think of. Since the pack tests aren’t graded, this is the only reason to test. If you’re <strong>confident</strong> that your code won’t trip up on an edge case or general use then you won’t need to test as much, but if you’re not you should write more.</p></div>

-------------------------------------------------
<p>You should test it as we have tested other ADT's in this class even if it is not graded: test all functions and try to come up with edge cases and normal cases for each. You want to be confident that your card and pack ADT's do not have bugs when you are writing Player and Euchre as those bugs will be harder to track down.</p>

-------------------------------------------------
<p>Can I test with pack sizes other than 24 to make testing easier? Or would that go against the ADT? I’m thinking about shuffle specifically in this context. </p>

-------------------------------------------------
<div class="markdown" id="q38kRj58oo1ooY"><p>Since the pack tests aren’t graded, you can use whatever you want for your tests. In theory, testing with a small input should expose the same bugs that a larger input would.</p>
<p>Just make sure that you remember to change <code>PACK_SIZE</code> back to 24 outside of your smaller pack size tests.</p></div>

<p dir="ltr">--EECS 280 Exam Team</p>


<p dir="ltr"></p>


<p dir="ltr"><strong>When To Take The Exam</strong></p>


<ul><li dir="ltr">
<p dir="ltr">At the regular time, unless you have made arrangements with us to take the exam at an alternate time.</p>
</li><li dir="ltr">
<p dir="ltr">If you have an extended time accommodation through the SSD office, your electronic exam and deadline on Canvas will be configured accordingly.</p>
</li></ul>


<p dir="ltr"><strong>Exam Format</strong></p>


<ul><li dir="ltr">
<p dir="ltr">The exam is administered online; you take it in your web browser.</p>
</li><li dir="ltr">The exam is "open everything". You may use any resources, including online resources. You may not collaborate with others.</li><li dir="ltr">
<p dir="ltr">You’ve got two hours to take the exam. Turn in your answers to Canvas before time is up.</p>
</li><li dir="ltr">
<p dir="ltr">Each student receives a random set of questions drawn from a large question bank.</p>
</li><li dir="ltr">
<p dir="ltr">Each student’s exam is “individually curved”. If you happen to get a harder set of questions, you’ll have a more generous curve.</p>
</li></ul>


<p dir="ltr"><strong>How To Take The Exam</strong></p>


<ol><li dir="ltr">
<p dir="ltr">An <strong>individualized exam link</strong> is emailed to you a couple days before the exam. When the exam starts, you can access your exam through that link (before the start of the exam, you’ll get a “404 not found” error for the link).</p>
</li><li dir="ltr">
<p dir="ltr">You take the exam in your web browser.</p>
</li><li dir="ltr">
<p dir="ltr">When you finish, click a button to download an <strong>answers file</strong>, which you must <strong>submit to Canvas</strong> before time is up.</p>
</li></ol>


<p dir="ltr"><strong>Exam Coverage</strong></p>


<ul><li>The midterm exam covers material from lectures 1-10 (up to and including polymorphism).</li><li>Note: Some of the older practice materials include a significant amount of content on “C-Style ADTs” (as you used in project 2). We are transitioning to focus more on “C++ Style ADTs” (as you used in project 3), and these will player a bigger role on our midterm exam.</li></ul>


<p dir="ltr"><strong>Live Practice Exam</strong></p>


<p dir="ltr">Your link for the live practice exam will be emailed Tuesday evening, 10/11 with subject line "EECS 280 F22 Live Practice Final Exam".

<p dir="ltr"><strong>Exam Interface:</strong></p>


<p dir="ltr">When you open the exam, you should get a welcome pop-up. If you don't see this (on either the practice exam or real exam), it means something went wrong and the page hasn't loaded correctly. Let us know if this happens.</p>


<p dir="ltr"></p>


<p dir="ltr">The exam interface should look generally like this in your web browser. If it doesn’t, please let us know. (Especially if page elements like the “Answers File” button are misplaced, or if you didn't get the welcome popup mentioned above.)</p>


<p dir="ltr"></p>


<p dir="ltr"><strong>Feedback/Issues</strong></p>


<p dir="ltr">Please use the follow-ups below to report any bugs/issues or other feedback.</p>


<p dir="ltr"></p>


<p dir="ltr"><strong>FAQ:</strong></p>


<p dir="ltr"></p>


<p dir="ltr"><strong>Q: Do I have to take the exam through my link?</strong></p>


<p dir="ltr">A: Yes. Each student’s exam is randomized, and we keep a record of who was assigned each question. If a student takes the exam through the wrong link, their questions won’t match up and they won’t receive credit. Please do not share your link with anyone.</p>


<p dir="ltr"></p>


<p dir="ltr"><strong>Q: How can I ask questions during the exam?</strong></p>


<p dir="ltr">A: You may ask questions on Piazza or join a Zoom call with staff. We're happy to answer questions about the questions, but we can't provide any information that assists in coming up with a solution.</p>


<p dir="ltr"></p>


<p dir="ltr"><strong>Q: Is the exam proctored? Do I need to join a zoom call or install proctoring software?</strong></p>


<p dir="ltr">A: No, but staff are available on a zoom call linked from the exam page in case you have questions.</p>


<p dir="ltr">Troubleshooting:</p>


<p dir="ltr"></p>


<p dir="ltr"><strong>Q: What should I do if I open the exam and I don't see the "popup" with the honor code info where I click "I understand"?</strong></p>


<p dir="ltr">A: This most likely means one of the 3rd part libraries used by the site didn't load correctly from its CDN. This can happen due to an unreliable internet connection or restrictions by your ISP or internet provider. Try refreshing the page a few times to see if it loads correctly. As long as it loads correctly once, you're all set (the exam application doesn't need to contact a server at all once it's started). If you have issues, please join our zoom call and we can help!</p>


<p dir="ltr"></p>


<p dir="ltr"></p>

-------------------------------------------------
<p>When I ask questions on piazza during the exam, will I create a private question addressed to only instructors or will I post a piazza post?</p>

-------------------------------------------------
<p>Yep, we'll change the settings on Piazza during the exam so that only private posts to instructors are allowed.</p>

-------------------------------------------------
<p>Is the exam open book?</p>

-------------------------------------------------
<p>See <a data-pats="post_ref" href="2342" onclick="return PE.gotoPost('2342');">@2342</a></p>

-------------------------------------------------
<div class="markdown" id="q38kRj58oo0ooY"><p>I tested positive for Covid today. Am I expected to still take the exam as normal on Wednesday?</p></div>

-------------------------------------------------
<p>Since the exam is remote, you can take it at the normal time if you like. But if you're not feeling reasonably well enough to take the exam, we can get you set up with an alternate, later time once you're doing better. Please send us an email or fill out the extension request form on eecs280.org.</p>

-------------------------------------------------
<p>What time will the Live Practice Exam be opened and closed?</p>

-------------------------------------------------
<div class="markdown" id="q38kRj58oo1ooY"><p>It’s called “live”, but you can actually take it whenever you’d like. I think by live they simply mean it’s got a timer and is in the same web format that you’ll encounter on the real exam.</p></div>

-------------------------------------------------
<p>How many of the questions will be multiple choice or short answers? How many total questions will there be?</p>

-------------------------------------------------
<p>We don't provide any specific details, but we generally try to make sure the format of the exam will not be surprising given the practice materials that we've given. The most notable difference is that there are some formats on the electronic exams (e.g. drag/drop code blocks) that just don't exist on the old paper exams.</p>

-------------------------------------------------
<p>for coding problems, will we be graded on how efficient our code is? for instance, if we come up with an inefficient solution for a problem will we get points off even if it produces the correct output?</p>

-------------------------------------------------
<div class="markdown" id="q38kRj58oo2ooY"><p>Likely not, we’ve only barely touched on time efficiency and it hasn’t been counted against us or enforced before.</p></div>

-------------------------------------------------
<p>For the midterm, we generally aren't going to ask you to write code with a particular efficiency. That might be a bit more relevant for the final exam and could show up in a minor way there, since we cover efficiency and complexity at an intro level in the 2nd half of the course.</p>


<p></p>


<p>However, one notable exception is that you should make sure to use best practices w.r.t. e.g. passing parameters correctly. For example, a string that you're not intending to modify should generally be passed by const reference, not by value.</p>

-------------------------------------------------
<p>I was never sent a practice exam link. What should I do?</p>

-------------------------------------------------
<p>Just forwarded it to you.</p>

-------------------------------------------------
<p>i have an exam link, no practice exam link</p>

-------------------------------------------------
<p>I never received a link to the practice exam. Is it possible to have it forwarded to me?</p>

-------------------------------------------------
<div class="markdown" id="q38kRj58oo3ooY"><p>No, since it is a personal link for the practice exam.</p>
<p>The format looks a lot like the sample solutions interface:
<a href="https://lobster.eecs.umich.edu/exam-distribution/exams/eecs280f22practice-midterm/sample-solution.html" target="_blank">https://lobster.eecs.umich.edu/exam-distribution/exams/eecs280f22practice-midterm/sample-solution.html</a></p>
<p>The real exam will also have a timer for your reference in the top left corner (though the time that your answers are submitted to Canvas is what really matters), and a “download answer file” button in the bottom left.</p></div>

-------------------------------------------------
<p>I was never sent an exam link, can it be forwarded to me or do I have to email someone about it?</p>

-------------------------------------------------
<div class="markdown" id="q38kRj58oo4ooY"><p>The links are personal, so you will not be able to have it forwarded to you.</p></div>

-------------------------------------------------
<p>What should I do about not having the exam link? The EECS280 website says we're supposed to have had them by yesterday morning but I never received an email with my personalized link.</p>

-------------------------------------------------
check your email by searching Midterm Exam Link

-------------------------------------------------
<p>If we have any questions related to the exam problems, where should we ask the question? Do we have the zoom link or something?</p>


<p></p>

-------------------------------------------------
I think the zoom link will be on the exam page? At least it was for the practice exam - it was on the side of the webpage

-------------------------------------------------
there is a zoom link and I think it is just the office hours

-------------------------------------------------
<p>When should we expect grades to be out for the exam?</p>

Shuffle question ( correct output after 7 shuffle )
<p>After shuffling the cards seven times with the in-shuffle, do I return to the same order as PacK.in ?? When I asserted the first three cards I got the same result as pack.in order. </p>

-------------------------------------------------
<p>Nope, you will return to the same order you started after 20 shuffles. 7 shuffles should make the pack different.</p>


<p></p>

-------------------------------------------------
<p>Is there any place where I can find the correct order after seven shuffles so that I can match it with my own shuffle output?</p>

-------------------------------------------------
<p>I believe the public case only tests the first card after 7 shuffles. Meaning it calls shuffle once and checks the first card. I would make a test that checks if the pack is the same as when you started. You can do this by creating 2 packs. Calling shuffle 20 times(meaning 140 individiual shuffles) on one pack, and checking if each card is equal in both packs. I also checked first if my cards were correct after 1 out of the 7 shuffles. I wrote out by hand what they would be after 1 shuffle(of 7), then printed out the hand and compared the results. </p>

Constructor args greater than 4
<p>I am missing style points due to too many parameters for my Game class constructor in euchre.cpp. Would the best solution to this be creating setter functions to initialize Game's private members?</p>

-------------------------------------------------
<p>It's probably the length of your lines, not the number of parameters. You should initialize like you would normally, and just break up the lines a bit</p>

-------------------------------------------------
<p>I see that you pass in the player one by one. Consider combining them together as a vector so you only need one argument instead of four.</p>

-------------------------------------------------
I would just make a separate player constructor and just use it to add the players 4 times.
<p></p>

-------------------------------------------------
<p>My partner and I combined the players into a players vector to be one parameter in the ctor but it's still counting each variable within the vector as an individual constructor in the autograder and were not passing that style check.</p>

Problem reading in from argv
<p>For some reason my argv is taking in the file location as well.  Note that the junk variable below is initialized to argv[0]. Therefore everything is one off. How do I fix this?</p>

-------------------------------------------------
<p>There is no problem, the 0th argument of argv is supposed to be the file path of the binary. The arguments you send to the program are stored in argv[1] and onward.</p>

-------------------------------------------------
<p>Yes, but the 0th argument is the file path and the 1st argument is euchre.exe, which is incorrect.</p>

In the terminal commad line, will it either be all simple player or all human players?
<p>will it be all human type players or all simple type players in the command line?</p>


<p>or can there be a mix of both types of players in a single command line?</p>

-------------------------------------------------
<p>You can mix the two as you wish</p>

-------------------------------------------------
<p>should the code be able to mix between the two or no? like will it be mixed in the autograder? or will the autogravder on give all simple or all human players?</p>

-------------------------------------------------
<p>I don't have any insight into the private euchre.cpp tests on the autograder, but I imagine they will test mixing simple and human players. From a design perspective, your game logic shouldn't discriminate between the player types; since the details of each player is abstracted away into Player.cpp, euchre.cpp shouldn't worry about it.</p>

#includes in euchre.cpp
<p>Do we #include "Player.h" or #include "Player.cpp" in euchre.cpp? Just wondering because Player.h doesn't have overrides of SimplePlayer and HumanPlayer that were written in the player cpp file</p>

-------------------------------------------------
<p>You always want to include the header file, never the cpp file. Because your Simple Player and Human Player were written in the Player.cpp file which *includes* the Player.h file itself, the compiler is smart enough to bundle it all together. You'll learn more about this concept in EECS 370 if you end up taking it.</p>

My code works when complied with address sanitizer but doesnt when compiled without it

<p></p>


<p></p>

-------------------------------------------------
<p>It's possible there's some undefined behavior in your code the address sanitizer isn't catching. Try re-compiling your code <strong>without</strong> the sanitizer, and then running the program under your debugger. Your debugger will stop on the failed assert, and you'll be able to trace why that assert failed from there.</p>


<p></p>


<p>Also, note that the assert "assert(false)" always fails when run. Did you leave this in your Game::findTeam() function by mistake?</p>

-------------------------------------------------
<p>I was able to find that address sanitizer was not running in visual studio, after enabling it I received these Access violation errors.<br/><br/></p>


<p>How do I fix them?</p>


<p><img alt="image.pngNaN" src="/redirect/s3?bucket=uploads&amp;prefix=paste%2Fky342nr86vr4or%2F7edc4e2abdc40cfef33955fe5d6d1980ea75af6eee391c54a199bffcce99b54f%2Fimage.png"/></p>

-------------------------------------------------
<p>Access violations occur when you access an invalid memory location; this could be caused by dereferencing a null or freed pointer, indexing out of the bounds of an array/vector, using member variables in a class that haven't been initialized by the constructor, etc. A common bug in P3 is forgetting to initialize member variables in the constructors you write. I would check that each constructor you wrote uses an initializer list, and initializes all of its member variables before reading them. If you don't find anything there, double-check you aren't walking off the end of any vectors/arrays.</p>


<p></p>


<p>Also correct me if I'm wrong, but it looks like you're running your code in Windows without using WSL. To get as close to the autograder's environment as possible, I recommend using WSL (or CAEN) to debug your code; ASan support will probably be better on both of those platforms, too.</p>

Adding the Upcard and Discarding a Card
<p>in the Adding the Upcard and Discarding a Card function for the simple player is the upcard considered trump for comparison of card worth? in other words, do we call</p>


<div>

-------------------------------------------------
<div class="markdown" id="q38kRj58oo0ooY"><p>When adding and discarding the upcard, you are at a point in the game where trump has been selected. Therefore you should use the <code>Card_less()</code> function since only it will consider trump when deciding card value.</p></div>

Reached Player.cpp, what are we supposed to function stubs are we supposed to put in?
<p>I just reached Player.cpp, what exactly do we put in there now? I remember in the setup it said to only put in Player_factory() and operator&lt;&lt;. What is the order we should code Player.cpp in?</p>

-------------------------------------------------
<div class="markdown" id="q38kRj58oo0ooY"><p>The function stubs it instructed for you to include at the beginning were so that the file would compile (but not work). You may now proceed to implement the Player.cpp functions, the order in which you do them doesn’t really matter. If one function requires the use of another one, then of course you would want to implement the used function first.</p></div>

-------------------------------------------------
<p>The two functions you listed are declared in the header file and we want you to implement them in the cpp file. They are not "member" functions.</p>


<p></p>


<p>Note that Player is an abstract class, you may want to implement the SimplePlayer's and HumanPlayer's own versions of functions (like add_card(), make_trump() etc.). You can also add member variables to these two classes.</p>

<p>You may want to add other helper functions if needed, and they might belong to a class (depends on how you want to use them).</p>

<p>queen_hearts</p>


<p>jack_hearts</p>


<p>jack_diamonds</p>


<p>ten_diamonds</p>

<div>if both the trump and lead suit are hearts,</div>


<div>the first card returned is jack of hearts</div>


<div>but the second card returned should be queen of hearts right? not the left bower jack of diamond?</div>

-------------------------------------------------
<div class="markdown" id="q38kRj58oo0ooY"><p>From the spec:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>If a Simple Player can follow suit, they play the highest card that follows suit. Otherwise, they play the lowest card in their hand.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Based on this, they would play their highest Hearts first which is Jack of Hearts (right bower). The next round, they follow the same strategy where now the Jack of Diamond (left bower) is the highest card that follows suit of Hearts.</p></div>

card test case
<p>Hi, I've been trying to debug with a test case of mine for AGES and the debugger just isn't cooperating (or maybe I don't know how to properly use it). </p>


<p>My test case:</p>


<p>    ASSERT_TRUE(Card_less(jackSpades, aceSpades, Card::SUIT_DIAMONDS));</p>


<p>is failing. All of my test cases for my operators are passing so I don't think that's the issue (but then again, maybe it is). In the function Card_less, I've noticed that it's skipping over this get_rank if, which should be catching it. I thought there could be an issue with my get_rank function but I'm not sure how. Similarly, I have a very similar test case that does the same thing with the other card_less function and it is also failing. Any help is appreciated! <img alt="Screen_Shot_2022-10-11_at_10.16.41_PM.png" src="/redirect/s3?bucket=uploads&amp;prefix=paste%2Fky4jflnunbk514%2Fa08b69844816c78506bbcf6b5a03aad193117bbf38c3d23d693d35d86a5a8654%2FScreen_Shot_2022-10-11_at_10.16.41_PM.png"/></p>

-------------------------------------------------
<div class="markdown" id="q38kRj58oo0ooY"><p>What type does <code>get_rank()</code> return? How would C++ compare two objects of that type? Is that comparison method what you want?</p>
<p>Hint: <code>"Jack"</code> starts with J, and <code>"Ace"</code> starts with A. <code>J</code> shows up after <code>A</code> in the alphabet.</p></div>

-------------------------------------------------
<p>So they're currently being compared by ASCII number. I don't want this because the value of their characters does not correlate with the card's value. Should I be attempting to make use of the names_by_weight arrays? I'm drawing a blank as to how I would do that. Would I write a helper function that runs a for loop comparing the string to the values in the array and then returning that value of the array, thus giving me a usable numerical comparison value?</p>

-------------------------------------------------
<div class="markdown" id="q38kRj58oo1ooY"><p>Yeah I think the solution you suggested would work well for your case. Reminder that helper functions should be defined as static and won’t appear in the Card.h file.</p></div>

Late submission of alternate exam. I am sorry.

I am an athlete, and at exactly this time we are playing Ohio State (Volleyball). I just submitted the form, but I wanted to reach out on piazza in case the forms don´t get attention anymore - as we are well past the deadline. </p>

euchre_test01.out.correct question
<p>From lines 19-23 in the euchre_test01.out.correct file, the following is listed: (the trump suit is HEARTS)</p>


<p></p>


<p>King of Diamonds led by Edsger<br/>Nine of Spades played by Fran<br/>Nine of Clubs played by Gabriel<br/>Queen of Diamonds played by Herb<br/>Edsger takes the trick</p>


<p></p>


<p>After doing some debugging, I saw that GABRIEL has a Jack of Diamonds. Shouldn't it be expected that Gabriel plays the Jack of Diamonds instead of the Nine of Clubs since Gabriel has a card that allows him to follow suit? Am I misunderstanding the rules of the game? I would appreciate a clarification.</p>

-------------------------------------------------
<p>The jack of diamonds is the left bower, so it is treated completely as if it is a heart. Thus, it is not the same suit as the king of diamonds. Even if you were to lead with the jack of diamonds, the led suit should still be hearts.</p>

How to use helper function from Card.cpp in Player.cpp?
<p>I have a helper function in Card.cpp that takes a Card, LeadSuit, and TrumpSuit and it returns a boolean value of whether or not this card is of the leadSuit. I want to use this function in my SimplePlayer implementation, so I pasted it as a private helper function. However, this has resulted in a style error where there is code duplication. How do I avoid this error? My uniqname is johnxie.</p>

-------------------------------------------------
<p>You should be able to format the function similar to the Card_less funcs in the Card.cpp as those are nto part of the card class but are still acessible if you include Card in your Player file. So if you put your helper functions under the Card less functions in Card.cpp you should be able to access them just by calling it normally in Player. </p>

-------------------------------------------------
<p>In response to the instructors' answer, isn't Card_less funcs only able to be called in Player.cpp because it was included in the Card.h file. However, in this project, aren't we unable to modify the Card.h file? Thus, I can't put my helper function's header in the Card.h file, and so I'm unable to call it in player.</p>

-------------------------------------------------
<div class="markdown" id="q38kRj58oo0ooY"><p>See <a data-pats="post_ref" href="2084" onclick="return PE.gotoPost('2084');">@2084</a>, you should just be able to write a non-member <code>static</code> function and it should be able to be called from other files.</p></div>

-------------------------------------------------
<p>But that issue is in the same cpp file. They are using a helper function in Player.cpp for SimplePlayer and HumanPlayer, but for me I have a helper function that I want to use in Card.cpp and Player.cpp. I tried declaring it as a static function in Card.cpp, but I am unable to call it in Player.cpp.</p>

shuffle function

<p></p>


<p><strong>In the shuffle, the deck is split exactly in half. The cards are weaved such that</strong></p>


<ul><li><strong>the top card of the bottom half is now the first card</strong></li><li><strong>the top card of the top half (original top card) is now the second card</strong></li><li><strong>the second card of the bottom half is now the third card</strong></li><li><strong>the second card of the top half is now the fourth card</strong></li><li><strong>…</strong></li><li><strong>the bottom card of the bottom half is now the twenty-third card</strong></li><li><strong>the bottom card of the top half is now the bottom card</strong></li></ul>

-------------------------------------------------
<div class="markdown" id="q38kRj58oo0ooY"><p>We do loop the whole process seven times. You can implement the shuffling any way you wish (creating an array of the indices, creating a new array with the new order, etc.). Just make sure to assign the new order to the original array/vector storing the cards.</p></div>

Struggling with trying to deal cards
<p>Hello, I'm trying to write a helper function in euchre.cpp to deal cards out to players. The function takes in the index of the dealer. The problem I'm having is attempting to "loop back" when going around and dealing. For instance, if dealer == 0, then each player would just be their index plus dealer. However, when dealer == 2, I'm having a hard time using that to go around the players since it would be dealt to player 3, player, 0, then player 1. Any ideas on how to go about this?</p>

-------------------------------------------------
Well I’m sure there’s many ways to solve this, but the first thing that comes to mind is to make an array:
<div><br/></div>
<div>Int example[7] = {0,1,2,3,0,1,2};</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>And then use example[dealer+i]. Just one option and it’s admittedly messy, but quick.</div>

-------------------------------------------------
<p>consider using an if / else clause and how you might be able to reset the player counter / index once it hits a certain value</p>

<p>Hi, I want to ask the problem wit this test case is that it access the private data right? If you use *Matrix_at, it would be no problem right? Do we need to not access data directly even if it is a struct not a class? Thank. you so much!</p>

-------------------------------------------------
Yes, you could repair this test case by using Matrix_at(). Because structs don't have functions, you cannot implement getter and setter functions that would allow you to respect the interface. This is why a class is optimal in this case.

-------------------------------------------------
<p>Thank you! So since it's a struct, we can only break the interface. But in practice, we could use class to fix this issue right?</p>

-------------------------------------------------
<div class="markdown" id="q38kRj58oo0ooY"><p>Yes you can make variables private in a class and make getter/setter functions to interact with it.</p>
<p>For this test case, you don’t have to break the interface you can instead call Matrix_at.</p></div>

-------------------------------------------------
<p>Also, we will not get a compile error if we break the interface for struct, but we will get one for class right?</p>

-------------------------------------------------
<div class="markdown" id="q38kRj58oo1ooY"><p>Yes, you aren’t able to access any private members outside of the class (we generally make member variables private).</p></div>

Human Player
<p>So in the spec I know it says "At the beginning of each hand, announce the hand, starting at zero, followed by the dealer and the upcard". Where in human player should this be implemented?

-------------------------------------------------
<div class="markdown" id="q38kRj58oo0ooY"><p>The exact code for this part would probably be more suited for the euchre.cpp file rather than a function in Player.cpp</p></div>

questions about C struct and C++ class
<p>Hi, I want to know whether c++ class is a better replacement for c struct, which means we could only need to know the c++ class. Or should we also learn about c struct? Thank you!</p>

-------------------------------------------------
Both are used for different uses. Structs (for the purpose of this class) cannot hold functions so C++ classes are more versatile in that respect. Structs are typically used when creating objects with a series of member variables, but can always be replaced by a class.

Question from Lecture 8 (ADT in C++)
<p>Sorry this might be from a while ago, I'm wondering for composing abstract data types in c++ (nested classes), is it possible for say Class A to be called in Class B, if Class B has also been called in Class A? What about when Class B calls another Class C in its member list, can Class B still be called in Class A's member list? (and so on) Thanks!</p>


<p></p>


<p>For example:</p>


<p></p>


<p>class Professor{</p>


<p>private:</p>


<p>Coffee favcoffee;</p>


<p>...</p>


<p>}</p>


<p></p>


<p>//while also having this</p>


<p>class Coffee{</p>


<p>private:</p>


<p>Professor favprofessor;</p>


<p>...</p>


<p>}</p>


<p></p>


<p></p>


<p>//what about this</p>


<p>class Coffee{</p>


<p>private:</p>


<p>Flavor allflavors[6];</p>


<p>...</p>


<p>}</p>


<p></p>


<p>class Flavor{</p>


<p>private:</p>


<p>...</p>


<p>public:</p>


<p>//define "allflavors"</p>


<p>...</p>


<p>}</p>

-------------------------------------------------
<div class="markdown" id="q38kRj58oo0ooY"><p>I would say this might not be allowed due to an infinite cycle occurring. Each member variable of a class will be instantiated either with a default value or a custom constructor. So since Coffee has a Professor object inside it, that Professor object will have its own Coffee object, and that Coffee object will then have its own Professor object, etc…</p></div>

lecture notes and textbook

using "break;" in a for loop
<p>I am currently writing a the play() function in the game class and for round 1 and 2 if a player calls up trump I don't want my code to consider what the next players would do in either of those rounds. I am tempted to use "if(true for orderedUp) break;". Would I receive points off for using the break keyword and if so what could be a better solution for this?</p>

void play();
<p>Is basically everything that we write (excluding private class and constructors) going to go inside the play() function? So when we call game.play() (and a little code that we write for game) in main, that's it?</p>

<p>This sounds like one way you could implement it! Euchre.cpp has a lot of design freedom and you can implement gameplay as you'd prefer. However, I would encourage you to remember that it's beneficial to break things into functions / helper functions to allow for code cleanliness/readibility/debugging!</p>

-------------------------------------------------
<p>Oh sorry. You should be calling make_trump on a player since it's a player member function. So like alice-&gt;make_trump. let me know if this doesn't fix it</p>

-------------------------------------------------
<p>it worked! is this for every player function?</p>

-------------------------------------------------
<p>also, do I have to delete each card I create at the end? the delete c has a squigly line under it</p>


<p></p>


<p>and now card is showing an error<img alt="Screen_Shot_2022-10-12_at_8.05.41_PM.pngNaN" src="/redirect/s3?bucket=uploads&amp;prefix=paste%2Fky0jv0a3uw5z8%2F48ae5694839e926d49a9442dfa85dc5f17fa6b9ce3b35dd5227c79db0ff9291c%2FScreen_Shot_2022-10-12_at_8.05.41_PM.png"/></p>

-------------------------------------------------
<p>yup! being a member function means you can only be called on instances of the class. i.e. alice-&gt;add_and_discard()</p>

-------------------------------------------------
<p>what about the error I'm getting now? :(</p>

-------------------------------------------------
<p>i've been struggling with the syntax for the player tests for days</p>

-------------------------------------------------
<p>make_trump wants a string by reference as its last parameter, and card::suit_hearts is a const string. try initializing a string and setting it equal to card::suit_hearts, then passing that in as your parameter</p>

-------------------------------------------------
<p>thank you! do i need to delete every Card object I create? If yes, how do I do it? </p>


<p></p>


<p>delete c gives me an error</p>


<p></p>

-------------------------------------------------
<p>no you don't. you only delete stuff that's dynamically allocated (i.e. Card c = new Card)</p>

Placement of sort function
<p>Would it be a bad idea to call the sort inside the print? It gives me a compiler error (so i would have to remove "const"). I can't think of anywhere else to put it, besides creating a second helper function just to call that one line of code?</p>

-------------------------------------------------
<p>like you said, you can't sort from inside print since it's const. you wouldn't be able to call a non-const helper function to do so either. you should print the hand as-is</p>

-------------------------------------------------
<p>If we print the hand as is, won't it print in the wrong order of cards? On autograder, the human hand always prints in order. </p>

Error with pack constructor

<p>This looks like a garbage value for next. Did you initialize next to an appropriate value before using it?</p>

-------------------------------------------------
<p>I initialized next to 0 and incremented it in the loop every time after each card is initialized, and at the end of the loop next=24 but I never access cards[24], I stop at cards[23]. I'm not sure why this is giving an error.</p>

Question about Pack Constructor number 2
<p>For the second Pack constructor, I'm reading in each line into rank, garbage, and suit but since this will only read in the rank and suit without the CARD:: in front, do I have to change each rank and suit to do this? Even after I do this, my test case is still skipping over the constructor and going on to the next function.</p>

-------------------------------------------------
<p>The "Card::" is just a namespace qualifier for the variable that comes after. For example, Card::RANK_TWO refers to the RANK_TWO variable inside the Card class (you can see this in Card.h). Card::RANK_TWO has a value of "Two", and Card::SUIT_SPADES has a value of "Spades", etc. So you shouldn't have to modify the input from the istream object in the Pack constructor.</p>


<p></p>


<p>Could you elaborate on what you mean by "skipping over" the constructor in your test, please?</p>

-------------------------------------------------
<p>When I was debugging the debugger skipped over the second pack constructor but now I got it to run but the test case fails. I think I'm reading in the pack.in wrong. When I read in, it's reading in the whole line. I'm not sure how I can make the program stop at every whitespace and then set the values of suit and rank appropriately to initialize each card.</p>

-------------------------------------------------
<p>If you're reading input into a string using the &gt;&gt; operator, the istream object should separate by whitespace by default. If you're using something like getline(), it will get the whole line of input, so I recommend the former approach.</p>

euchre.cpp length
<p>approximately how many lines is euchre.cpp supposed to be when done? </p>

-------------------------------------------------
<p>There is no length euchre.cpp is "supposed" to be, as each implementation will be of slightly different length. For reference, my solution is about 300 lines, but yours could definitely be more or less, due to a range of both trivial factors (like newlines and how you format your code) and important decisions (like how well you re-use your code).</p>


<p></p>


<p>It sounds like you're more interested in the question "how much effort will euchre.cpp take?" Line count is not an accurate indicator of effort, but I'll say this: Most students (myself included) spend way more time debugging euchre than writing it. This is true not just for EECS 280, but for complex projects in general. If you work consistently on P3 now so you give yourself ample time to debug later, you'll set yourself up nicely for success. :)</p>

reference and pointer
<p>Hi, I want to ask the difference between a pointer * to a variable and the reference &amp; of a variable. So, the reference does't take memory and we don't really create anything and the reference can't change right? Can an object have more than one reference? On the other hand, the pointer takes memory and can point to other object right? When we should use reference and when we should use pointer? Thank you so much!</p>

-------------------------------------------------
<blockquote>
<p>So, the reference doesn't take memory and we don't really create anything</p>
</blockquote>


<p>The details of how references use memory are a bit complicated, and definitely aren't needed in 280. But in a nutshell, in some cases (like if you have a local variable and a reference to it in a function), the compiler can treat a reference exactly as an "alias" for the original variable, and just replace all uses of the reference with the original variable -- this means the reference takes no additional memory. In other cases (like if you have a function that takes references as input), the compiler might implement the reference with a pointer, which does take memory. But you don't have to worry about these details.</p>


<p>You are correct that the reference does not create any new data, but instead becomes another name for an object. at runtime.</p>


<p></p>


<blockquote>
<p>and the reference can't change, right?</p>
</blockquote>


<p>Yes, you're correct. When creating a reference, you must set it equal to a variable, and after the reference has been set to alias another variable, it cannot be set to a different variable. For example, "int &amp;a;" is a compiler error because you declared a reference, but didn't set it to a variable. Also, "int &amp;a = x; a = y" does not set a to alias y, but instead sets x to be the same value as y.</p>


<p></p>


<blockquote>
<p>Can an object have more than one reference?</p>
</blockquote>


<p></p>


<p>Yes, you can have multiple references to the same object.</p>


<p></p>


<blockquote>
<p>On the other hand, the pointer takes memory and can point to other object right?</p>
</blockquote>


<p></p>


<p>Yes, once a non-const pointer is set to point to an object, it can be set to point to a different object. However, you don't want to lose track of the first object, because if it was dynamically allocated (i.e. with the "new" keyword), you're responsible for deleting it, which requires a pointer to it.</p>


<p></p>


<blockquote>
<p>When we should use reference and when we should use pointer?</p>
</blockquote>


<p></p>


<p>In general, pointers can do everything references can do, but references cannot do everything pointers can do. For example, if you want to pass an object to a function without making a copy of it, you can write the function to take a reference as input, or a pointer as input. However, if you want to keep track of an object in dynamic memory, you must use a pointer. Also, references cannot do pointer arithmetic, which is sometimes useful. Overall, pointers are more powerful, but arguably harder to use correctly -- they introduce an entire class of errors, like null pointer dereferences and dereferencing de-allocated/invalid memory.</p>


<p></p>


<p>If you can use references to implement something (like a function that is pass-by-reference), I recommend you use them instead!</p>

question about const

<div class="markdown" id="q38kRj58oo0ooY"><p>A function that has the <code>const</code> tag at the end of it means that you can’t modify the member variables of the class. You can still create and edit local variables, but you can only read member variables, not edit them. For example:</p>

use of the helper functions in game class
<p>if I wanted to use the helper functions in the game class, what would that look like? I am confused on how one would use the helper functions in the game class when we have already implemented these same functions?</p>

-------------------------------------------------
<p>If you have implemented these helper functions as member functions in the Game class, you can simply call them where necessary in play().</p>


<p></p>


<blockquote>
<p>how one would use the helper functions in the game class when we have already implemented these same functions?</p>
</blockquote>


<p>Just to clarify, the shuffle/deal/make_trump/etc. helper functions in the Game class mentioned in the spec aren't the same functions as those in Pack/Player/etc. (even though they have the same names -- sorry about the confusion there!). The idea here is that the Game functions use those functions in Player/Pack/etc. as necessary to implement a part of the game's logic. For example, each Player has their own make_trump() function; how can you put their individual functionality together to make trump for an actual round of Euchre?</p>

-------------------------------------------------

------------------------@2131-------------------------
Argv question
<p>In the Design section of the spec it shows char **argv being used in main, but I can't seem to figure out how to actually use that to compare anything in my actual code. In project 2 I used char *argv to make sure all the command line arguments were ok, am I not allowed to just use *argv here too? Or would that not work for some reason?</p>

-------------------------------------------------
<p>You can most definitely use argv, and you will probably have to for euchre.cpp</p>
